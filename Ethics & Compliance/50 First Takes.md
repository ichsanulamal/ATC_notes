A key indicator to look out for is the [External] tag in the subject line and the external email header in the body of the email.
Never reply directly to the email, never forward it along to others, and only click on links to reputable or known websites. You can hover over the link to verify authenticity (look for HTTPS, rather than HTTP, as an indicator that it is a secure link).
