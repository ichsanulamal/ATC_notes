# Code of Business Ethics (COBE)

## Make your conduct count

Respect, inclusiveness, and shared ethical values are at the heart of Accenture’s culture and grounded in our core values. Making your conduct count is about fostering these values and describes behaviors that we expect from—and for—our people so that they can be at their best each day. There are five ways to make sure your conduct counts.
Speaking Up and Zero Tolerance for Retaliation
Respect for the Individual
Behaving Professionally
Meritocracy and Non-Discrimination
Personal Conflicts of Interest

## Comply with laws

We comply with all laws, whether local, national, or regional. Accenture people, and those acting on our behalf, are responsible for understanding the applicable rules and must work with Legal to ensure compliance. Violations of law can result in significant harm to Accenture, including financial penalties, denial of government contracting privileges, imprisonment for criminal misconduct, and damage to our business relationships and reputation.

## Deliver for our clients

We all serve Accenture’s clients, regardless of role—focusing on the best interests of our clients while acting as stewards of Accenture.

## Protect people, information, and our business

We work together to build a better, stronger, and more durable company for future generations, protecting the Accenture brand, meeting our commitments to protect information and intellectual property, acting with an owner mentality, and protecting and developing our people.

## Run our business responsibly

We are agile and we strive for high performance—by acting as entrepreneurs and owners of the company. We use sound business judgment to make decisions and do so within our authority, using informed judgment to take appropriate risks and remaining accountable even where decision making is automated. We recognize the limits to our individual authority. When situations arise that require a more specialized or senior-level review, we are prudent in our decision making and seek counsel. We spend Accenture’s money as if it were our own. We are vigilant and responsible with resources with an eye to the bottom line. We speak up when we see waste.

## Be a good corporate citizen

We support and respect human rights, foster environmental responsibility, and encourage our people’s involvement in the communities where we work and live.
