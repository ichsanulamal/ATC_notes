Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
This course will demystify the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), taking you from foundational concepts to practical applications. You'll learn to distinguish AI and ML, explore how algorithms learn, and perform common tasks like classification and clustering. You will begin by learning to confidently distinguish between the broad umbrella of AI and the specific subset of ML, understanding how each contributes to the landscape of intelligent systems. Next, you'll explore the milestones that shaped AI. Then you will discover how to classify the diverse approaches of machine learning. Finally, you will explore the practical aspects of common machine learning problems. You'll learn the meaning of regression, classification, and clustering and how they're applied in real-world scenarios. Discover how to evaluate model performance and explore the workings of popular traditional models like linear regression and decision trees. You'll also be introduced to ensemble learning, where the "wisdom of the crowds" fuels even more accurate predictions.
