00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.719
What you're seeing on screen is actually with respect to a github uh

1
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.309
Copilot. If it is a Java Prog program, right, we might be making use of an

2
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.620
eclipse which is an integrated development environment.

3
00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:30.860
If we are using Python,

4
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.580
then we might be making use of a Jupiter as an integrated development environment.

5
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.419
Now,

6
00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.299
uh these

7
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.669
integrate ID es

8
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:46.659
they have plugins. Now um the you know, the copilots can

9
00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.869
uh can easily plug into the ID E.

10
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.319
So typically when a developer, you know, they go ahead and uh write, you know,

11
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.900
they write a function, right.

12
00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.880
So they will be able to, so the moment they start typing a function or write a text,

13
00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:05.709
say convert hexadecimal to uh color code, right?

14
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.040
So then it will

15
00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:08.444
um

16
00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:11.964
you know, it will start uh writing that code.

17
00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:14.794
So it is it's basically a pair programming.

18
00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:20.084
So through copilot will be quick in a position to quickly uh you know,

19
00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:21.444
generate the code.

20
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:23.035
It also helps in

21
00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:25.084
uh remediating that code

22
00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:28.504
and also it helps in, you know, the test case generation.

23
00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:34.385
So this is um with this is a simple gen A I application for code generation.

24
00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.644
And completion that we are seeing over here.
