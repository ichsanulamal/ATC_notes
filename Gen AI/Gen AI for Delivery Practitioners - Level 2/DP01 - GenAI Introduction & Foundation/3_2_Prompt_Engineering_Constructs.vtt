This video is about the basic construct of prompts.

1
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:20.379
There are three fundamental steps

2
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.010
in formulating prompts

3
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.020
content

4
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.879
instructions

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.530
and examples.

6
00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:31.409
Content is the information

7
00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.740
that is provided to the large language model. For task execution.

8
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.790
It could be a passage from a document tabler data like CSV

9
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.549
etc.

10
00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:45.939
And this can be presented as a prompt

11
00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.119
instructions are used to convey the tasks the

12
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.119
LM models need to accomplish.

13
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.930
This is done by utilizing the gen

14
00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.099
A I patterns

15
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.159
that was already discussed in the previous sessions.

16
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.759
For instance,

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.270

and a service desk agent

23
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.769
analyze and process the sales data

24
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.889
provided in a CS V file.

25
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.410
In order to ensure the output is formatted

26
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.569
and tailored. The way required examples may need to be provided in the prompt.

27
00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:32.970
For example,

28
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.050

content provides the task information

40
00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.410
instructions utilize genai

41
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.729
patterns for task execution.

42
00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.320
And examples focus on enhancing content, understanding

43
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.940
and pinpoint aspects or extraction details

44
00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.300
and specifies the desired output format to

45
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:31.619
ensure the responses align with specific requirements.

46
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.460
Thank you.
