## Basic Constructs of Prompts

### Overview
The formulation of prompts consists of three fundamental components: content, instructions, and examples. Each plays a critical role in guiding large language models (LLMs) to produce accurate and relevant outputs.

### 1. Content
- **Definition**: The information provided to the LLM for task execution.
- **Types of Content**:
  - Text passages from documents.
  - Structured data like CSV files.
  
### 2. Instructions
- **Purpose**: Convey the specific tasks the LLM needs to accomplish.
- **Examples of Instructions**:
  - "Answer the question: What are the major steps to reprocess an invoice?"
  - "Generate a project management plan for an upcoming release."
  - "Summarize the call conversation between a user and a service desk agent."
  - "Analyze and process the sales data provided in a CSV file."

### 3. Examples
- **Importance**: Providing examples helps to ensure the output is formatted and tailored to specific requirements.
- **Types of Examples**:
  - "Provide a concise summary in bullet points."
  - "Focus on legal compliance aspects in the policy document."
  - "Extract SLA compliance data for incidents over the last six months from the provided CSV file, and format the output in a concise bulleted list or table."

### Summary
In crafting effective prompts:
- **Content** provides the task information.
- **Instructions** utilize generative AI patterns for task execution.
- **Examples** enhance understanding and specify output formats, ensuring that the responses align with specific requirements.

By effectively combining these three constructs, users can significantly improve the quality of outputs generated by LLMs. Thank you!

## In-Context Learning Techniques

In this segment, we explore three key in-context learning techniques that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs): zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, and few-shot learning. Each technique plays a distinct role in how LLMs interpret and respond to prompts.

### 1. Zero-Shot Learning
- **Definition**: This technique allows the LLM to generate responses based solely on the instructions provided, without any examples.
- **Example**: Asking the model, "What is the capital of India?" The model can provide the correct answer (New Delhi) based on its pre-training, without needing any context or examples.

### 2. One-Shot Learning
- **Definition**: In this approach, the user provides one example alongside the prompt. The model uses this example to generate a relevant response.
- **Example**: If you instruct the model to "Generate a ticket data template with fields like ticket description, assigned to, and priority," including a single example helps the model understand the expected output structure.

### 3. Few-Shot Learning
- **Definition**: This method involves providing a few examples to guide the model in predicting outcomes for similar tasks.
- **Example**: When classifying defects, you might present a few examples (e.g., "Defect A: configuration defect," "Defect B: design defect"). The model uses these to generalize and classify additional defects correctly.

### Best Practices for Prompt Writing
To maximize the effectiveness of prompts, consider the following best practices:

1. **Provide Context**: Offer as much relevant information as possible to avoid hallucination and ensure the model understands the specifics of the request. For instance, a prompt about losing access keys should clearly specify the context.

2. **Explicit Instructions**: Encourage the model to think critically by asking it to weigh pros and cons or consider the implications of its recommendations. For example, when troubleshooting an application issue, prompt the model to evaluate the impact of actions like restarting a server.

3. **Use Examples**: Clearly outline how the output should be structured. Specify formats (e.g., lists, tables) and the aspects to focus on.

4. **Set Constraints**: Limit the response by specifying word counts or focus areas. For instance, ask the model to summarize a document in 250 words while emphasizing legal or security aspects.

5. **Explore Different Formats**: Experiment with the phrasing of promptsâ€”ask questions, make statements, or adopt different perspectives to see how it affects the output.

6. **Iterate and Refine**: After receiving responses, assess their quality. If they fall short, refine the prompts continuously to improve accuracy and relevance.

By understanding these techniques and best practices, users can significantly enhance the interaction with LLMs, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate outputs.

## Vector Search and Its Role in Generative AI

### Overview of Vector Embeddings
Vector embeddings are essential in bridging human-readable data and computational algorithms, enabling generative AI to process natural language queries effectively. When a user poses a question, such as "What are the potential root causes for the failure of job XYZ?", the generative AI must understand the query, apply computational algorithms, and provide a relevant response.

### What Are Vector Embeddings?
- **Definition**: Vector embeddings transform various data types, such as text and images, into numerical representations that AI can understand.
- **Functionality**: These embeddings capture similarities and relationships between different data points, allowing the AI to understand context and generate meaningful outputs efficiently.

### Key Concepts
1. **Vectors**: Fixed-length arrays of numbers representing points in space. Each dimension corresponds to a unique aspect of the data.
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Numerical representations of typically non-numerical data, capturing essential properties and relationships in a condensed format.
3. **Vector Store**: A specialized database designed to manage and store vectors for efficient retrieval.

### Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge graphs represent entities, attributes, and relationships, providing context and meaning to data. They enhance generative AI solutions by grounding responses in validated facts and linking diverse data sources together.

### Semantic Search
Semantic search goes beyond traditional keyword search by understanding the intent and context behind user queries. For example, the word "job" can have different meanings based on context, and semantic search ensures that responses are accurate and contextually relevant.

### Key Processes in Semantic Search
1. **Vector Search**: Encodes information into vectors to determine similarity.
2. **Query Transformation**: User queries are transformed into numerical representations (embeddings).
3. **Matching Process**: Algorithms (e.g., K-nearest neighbor) match query vectors to existing document vectors based on conceptual relevance.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating an information retrieval system. It allows LLMs to access external, relevant information during query response generation, ensuring accuracy and context relevance, especially for specific client queries.

### Use Case: Supermart X Incident Management
In a retail scenario, Accenture supports application maintenance through level two incident management. By automating root cause analysis using generative AI, historical incident data can help identify potential causes for new incidents.

### Process Breakdown
1. **Initial Vector Store Setup**: Extract incident details from a system (e.g., ServiceNow), preprocess text, tokenize descriptions, and encode features into dense vectors.
2. **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Identify entities (incidents, root causes) and define their relationships (e.g., "Incident 001 has a root cause of misconfiguration").
3. **New Incident Processing**: When a new incident arises, it undergoes preprocessing and encoding. A semantic search retrieves similar historical incidents using cosine similarity to determine potential root causes.
4. **Response Generation**: The AI synthesizes a response based on augmented prompts and retrieved information, which is then updated in the incident record.

### Conclusion
By integrating vector embeddings, knowledge graphs, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation, generative AI solutions can provide contextually accurate and efficient responses, unlocking significant business value in incident management and other applications.
