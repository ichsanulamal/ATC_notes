This video is about an introduction to prompt engineering. A

1
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.590
prompt is a set of instructions provided to large

2
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.790
language models with the objective of obtaining a response.

3
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.389
Prompt engineering is a technique used in large

4
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.069
language models to guide and control their output.

5
00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:38.709
The primary aim is to provide specific instructions or data

6
00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:43.310
to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the model's responses.

7
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.580
In the context of gen

8
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.790
A

9
00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.689
prompt engineering involves designing input queries or commands that instruct

10
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.779
the A I on what kind of output is desired.

11
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.310
Prompt engineering is crucial

12
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.419
because it directly influences the quality and

13
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.830
relevance of the A I generated content.

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.870
Effective prompt engineering not only improves the

15
00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.180
position of the A I generated content

16
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.230
but also plays a vital role in tailoring

17
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.889
responses to meet user expectations and ethical standards.

18
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.510
By carefully crafting prompts,

19
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.910
we ensure a more reliable and user friendly interaction with the A I system,

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.669
creating an experience

21
00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:32.790
that aligns with user needs and ethical considerations.

22
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.970
Prompt engineering is a technique

23
00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:37.980
that guides

24
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.430
A I systems ensuring they produce accurate and relevant information

25
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.050
leading to positive

26
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.900
and ethical interaction with users and optimized gen A I results. It is

27
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.279
important to note that

28
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.010
crafting precise problems is critical in producing

29
00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:59.559
accurate and contextually relevant A I outputs

30
00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.750
effective prompt engineering is a key factor in minimizing the

31
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.850
trial and error typically associated with eliciting desired outputs,

32
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.529
resulting in

33
00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.110
substantial savings of time and resources.

34
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.899
By contextualizing and fine tuning problems.

35
00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.089
Large language models can be used for generating

36
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.639
content across the technology delivery life cycle.

37
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.160
And it can also be used for generating

38
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.279
insights and recommendations based on various metrics.

39
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.419
In addition, finely tuned prompts coupled with correct contextual information,

40
00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.940
ensure that LMS

41
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.029
do not hallucinate or generate incorrect information.

42
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.820
Thank you.
