00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:16.309
So ja I

1
00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.329
opportunities across

2
00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:23.149
the technology delivery life cycle. That is what TDLC stands for.

3
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.790
So the first and foremost thing uh we need to

4
00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:30.069
focus on is understand the patterns in gene A I.

5
00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.110
So when we say understanding the patterns, right?

6
00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.569
So there are different types of patterns. So

7
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.069
like generation.

8
00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:42.590
So what do we mean by generation? So when we say generation,

9
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.849
it could be, you know, generating a survey,

10
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.000
generating a template,

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.000
right? So the generating uh uh requirements with a complete acceptance criteria,

12
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:57.409
generating a test case.

13
00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:03.509
So like that, uh you know, that is what generation is all about then completion.

14
00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.489
So when we say completion, it is actually

15
00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:07.500
uh

16
00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.160
completing uh information.

17
00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.319
So you start writing a piece of code,

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.000
then you know the the through ja I you will be able to complete it,

19
00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:21.800
you you give the un user story, it will be in a position to

20
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.040
complete the user story with the right acceptance criteria,

21
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:33.730
right? So that is the completion then synthesis. So when we say synthesis,

22
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.720
it is more focused on,

23
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.269
you know, collating information

24
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.269
or collecting the information from multiple sources and then

25
00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:45.040
uh

26
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.919
and creating it in a presentable format. Say, for example,

27
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.069
um if you're familiar,

28
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.150
if I'm not sure how many of you are in the support uh space in the operation space,

29
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.440
right?

30
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.040
So, but typically in an operation space, for example,

31
00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.209
um there can be a scenario where there might be

32
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.610
an issue with respect to uh a job failure.

33
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.850
So when there is a job failure, right, typically what happens is

34
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.429
the support team goes ahead and looks into multiple log files. So

35
00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:19.029
and so what to do and then they come up

36
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.839
that particular information,

37
00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:26.009
right? So, but this entire process it can be done through ja I,

38
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.869
so you where in which you

39
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.889
all that information? So that is synthesis, then analysis,

40
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.429
analysis is actually once you collate all that particular information,

41
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.779
you analyze it to identify

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.029
what could be the root cause of a particular issue, right? So that is the analysis.

43
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.750
Then summarization,

44
00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:50.850
summarization is all about, you know, say for example, you know, somebody is uh

45
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.139
uh makes a call, right? Or during your

46
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.580
on on on a day to day basis, you have multiple calls, right? It's on an ongoing thing.

47
00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.050
But and post that particular call, you would want to uh you know,

48
00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.490
uh quickly create a minutes of the meeting,

49
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.220
summarize the gist of that particular conversation.

50
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.839
Now,

51
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.250
that entire thing can

52
00:03:10.354 --> 00:03:14.764
transcribed, then you can create a summary out of it using a gen A I,

53
00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:20.404
right? So that is summarization then sentiment analysis. So typically

54
00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:25.945
uh any uh text or any content that is spoken, right?

55
00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.895
So it all there is there might be either a

56
00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:32.664
positive sentiment or a negative sentiment or there could be a

57
00:03:32.914 --> 00:03:34.285
neutral sentiment.

58
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.399
Now, when we actually, and uh when we go with the traditional A I,

59
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.500
we need to train the model to, you know,

60
00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.339
understand what was the sentiment of that particular text.

61
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.029
Now through gen A I, you just provide a particular test text.

62
00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.710
It will be in a position to give you what was the particular sent, right?

63
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.169
Which the particular user might have uh you know,

64
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.380
with which the user might have spoken about, then there is remit.

65
00:03:57.326 --> 00:04:00.356
So when we say remediation, it is all about fixing.

66
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:05.856
So yeah, typically, you know, once a code is developed, then what happens, you know,

67
00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:08.466
we might want to review that particular code.

68
00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:13.576
So typically, what do we do? We go ahead and we make use of uh different tools.

69
00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:18.630
One of the tools may be, you know, it could be a Sonar cube. So for um so so not

70
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.450
cube is a tool which is used for code review

71
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.101
for those who may not really be familiar with that.

72
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.170
So now once you I I review the code,

73
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.050
then it might identify what could be the issues in the code.

74
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:36.871
Now you have to go ahead and fix it, right? So when you are so through ja I,

75
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.601
you will be in a position to quickly

76
00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:43.839
you know, fix that particular code, then segmentation of that code,

77
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.730
uh segmentation is more of clustering.

78
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:48.829
So you, you give it have a incident description,

79
00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:52.470
then it will be in a position to uh cluster that then again,

80
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.940
translation translation is all about, you know, translating, you know,

81
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.670
say from one language to another,

82
00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:03.869
maybe from Spanish to English or German to English or you know,

83
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:05.032
translating, you know,

84
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:08.772
from one programming language to another programming language,

85
00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:12.712
maybe from uh uh uh C program to a Java program.

86
00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:16.261
So like that, then Q and A is more about, you know, you ask a question,

87
00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:20.032
get a response and then classification, you have some defects,

88
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:22.302
you might want to classify it, you know, as a

89
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:27.872
um you know, uh simple medium complex and so on. And typically,

90
00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:32.114
you know, we typically, what we do is we go ahead and provide labels.

91
00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:35.114
But now all these things, you can just go ahead and uh you know,

92
00:05:35.123 --> 00:05:38.114
you can perform through JA I but, and,

93
00:05:38.123 --> 00:05:43.394
and this is what uh these are the different uh patterns that we see uh across here now.

94
00:05:43.403 --> 00:05:46.634
And what we see over here is this uh across the different

95
00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:50.183
areas in the technology delivery life cycle that I already spoke about,

96
00:05:50.194 --> 00:05:50.533
right?

97
00:05:50.544 --> 00:05:51.834
So with respect to in

98
00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:56.855
requirements, so in requirements, you can go ahead and create the requirements,

99
00:05:56.865 --> 00:05:59.615
you'll be able to then summarizing those requirements,

100
00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:02.196
then generating the prototypes, right?

101
00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:05.415
And then again, you know, based on the user stories or requirements,

102
00:06:05.425 --> 00:06:10.455
generating the design documents, then generating an architectural diagram,

103
00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:12.786
you know the technical, the functional architecture,

104
00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:15.786
the application architecture, the technical architecture.

105
00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.489
Then again from a development I like I told about it's uh generating code,

106
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.170
analyzing the code remediating the code, then testing in testing,

107
00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:26.220
generating test cases data,

108
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.910
then automation, then you might have a regression test suit.

109
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.760
You might want to optimize a particular regression test suit.

110
00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:36.200
You might want to uh you know, there could be duplicate uh regression test.

111
00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.410
So you might look at your,

112
00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.959
you know, you might want to optimize the entire regression test bed, right.

113
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.630
Then while deploying, you might, you might want to, you know,

114
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.649
if you're having AC I CD pipeline, you might generate the terraform scripts,

115
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.320
you might perform the infrastructure provisioning and

116
00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:54.220
then deploy then again from a support standpoint

117
00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:56.470
uh in operate, you know, it's

118
00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.869
automatically,

119
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.839
you know, synthesizing and analyzing the root causes,

120
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.239
then uh enriching ticket data and then automating generating the documents.

121
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.869
So all these things and then again,

122
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.839
there are multiple aspects and from a collaboration standpoint,

123
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.239
then document search knowledge management and so on.

124
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.589
So these are the different NA

125
00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:20.149
I opportunities across the technology delivery life cycle.
