00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:08.239
What we are going to do is cover the

1
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.899
training objectives and expectations from all of you.

2
00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.800
This is not like a one time done and dusted training, you,

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.120
you will have to continuously apply these

4
00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.750
skills within your engagements within your projects

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.030
and have discussions with your clients.

6
00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.930
So let me tell you the difference between the three trainings.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.459
First,

8
00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.760
there are three trainings that we have launched based

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.879
on the role that you are going to play

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.439
most of you on today's training fall under the delivery practitioner,

11
00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:39.909
which is for levels uh right from CL 12 up to CL seven,

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.229
there are two other trainings if you wish to uh

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.860
get or graduate or post graduate into an automation architect,

14
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.909
that would be your next part uh which is for cl nine to CL four,

15
00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:55.340
but it is only applicable for selected and nominated people

16
00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:58.439
as it's a very rigorous course and more duration.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.189
Those who are moving on to the project management path,

18
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.110
going to become delivery leads or technology service leads CL six.

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.819
And uh to above

20
00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:11.629
uh they can graduate into the uh the first course mentioned here.

21
00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:17.250
Now, most all the three courses have more or less similar

22
00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.699
uh self learning courses that you have done.

23
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.230
I have myself gone through all the self learning courses

24
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.529
and I have also recommended few additions to be done

25
00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.949
what you would have covered in the level one course so far,

26
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.470
uh you have gone through the talent question.

27
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.589
You would have gone through the basics of uh A I and ML

28
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.879
you would have learned what is JA

29
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.949
I and applying practically on applications using API S and chat GP T.

30
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.709
Uh You would have gone through the JA

31
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.059
I essentials which covered the overview LLM models.

32
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.650
How does it work? What is responsible A I

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.459
legal aspects and security aspects around applying gen A I

34
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.190
and then you did some grounded foundational hands

35
00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:01.139
on work understanding what is prompt engineering,

36
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.669
which is very essential for applying gen A I use cases.

37
00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.900
Uh What are the basics of vector data

38
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.229
stores and what are the different ecosystem tools

39
00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:11.800
coming up in the market?

40
00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.949
The few short courses that I have recommended and will get added very soon.

41
00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.240
Uh These are, these are not mandatory for you to complete today's class,

42
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.039
but after you complete today's class, you can go and complete the other ones

43
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.410
that will get you knowledge about uh

44
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.740
the transformers architecture,

45
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.570
what are embeddings and how to use embeddings to

46
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.000
build your own custom applications on JA I.

47
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.330
Uh you will have some extra hands on, on prompt engineering,

48
00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:42.869
especially focusing on pair programming.

49
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.770
And if you are interested, there are two additional optional courses.

50
00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.750
One is on how to use github

51
00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.619
Copilot, especially if you are developers getting started with it.

52
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.199
And second is on fine tuning of the LLN

53
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.860
what you will learn today,

54
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.190
you will have details around what is the accenture differentiation of assets.

55
00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.449
So accenture,

56
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.449
invest a lot in building competitive differentiation

57
00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.759
and those are the assets that you will go through at a high level.

58
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.559
You will understand the architecture around it

59
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.949
and how it works along with the other ecosystem tools.

60
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.889
And most of the time you will be doing hands on

61
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.410
either using directly LLM models, prompt engineering

62
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.130
or focusing on the use cases on ems I MS SI custom S ISA P

63
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.800
uh using the accenture assets. So that's going to be your entire course content.

64
00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.809
As I said,

65
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.369
if you wish to graduate into the other two courses based on your eligibility,

66
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.490
you feel free to do that later on.

67
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.250
Now, what's expected out of you and the objective

68
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.990
there has been a very significant progress on gen A I

69
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.029
within the managed services world as well as the system integration work.

70
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.270
Now,

71
00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:01.309
we have to keep our competitive differentiation high compared to our competitors.

72
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.539
Everybody is working on this. So that's not new.

73
00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.300
And if we don't keep our competitive differentiation high,

74
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.630
our growth gets hindered and our delivery also gets entered.

75
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.889
So you need to understand what is the differentiation accenture brings on the table

76
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.880
and you should be able to have those

77
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.238
level of conversations with your clients within your engagements

78
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.619
as and when needed.

79
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.059
That's what you will learn. And you are expected to know that very thorough.

80
00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:29.209
Second,

81
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:34.570
the ways of working or ways of delivery are evolving from new to it has become new,

82
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.200
new or not new.

83
00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:38.440
And the genea

84
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.850
is very

85
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.809
uh entrenched within every activity, every task that you do.

86
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.589
So that changes the me earlier mechanics of

87
00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:53.089
uh you will have a very thorough documentation, step by step instruction.

88
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.089
No, you will not.

89
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.000
You will have to figure out mechanics on how to automate your task,

90
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.730
how to automate your activities,

91
00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:04.079
how to quickly move from one activity to the next activity

92
00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:05.790
without changing the context.

93
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.720
And these are very evolving. Not everything is thorough and put on paper,

94
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.170
you will learn yourself as you go through it.

95
00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:17.019
And all of these at the end of the day

96
00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:18.940
improves productivity

97
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.369
and reduces cost. So that's the bottom line.

98
00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:24.010
That's the expectation.

99
00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:28.380
So you should learn, what are these use cases that you can automate using gen A I,

100
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.920
how to apply responsible A I

101
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:34.579
and prepare yourself to adopt the new ways of working.

102
00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:39.510
Third, if you look at the landscape of the tooling,

103
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.170
it's that is also evolving very fast.

104
00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:47.239
Many LLM models. What are these different type of LLM models? When should I use?

105
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.899
Which one?

106
00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:50.790
When should you fine tune versus when should you use?

107
00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.690
Prompt engineering and prompt tuning,

108
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.459
uh which ecosystem tools you should use?

109
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.779
What's the best one applicable to your work?

110
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.890
What are the implications from legal and security angle?

111
00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:03.299
What are the new skills that you will require?

112
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.829
Whether it is prompt engineering, vector data stores,

113
00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.640
embeddings and how to apply that so on and so forth.

114
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.579
So you need to understand the basics of all.

115
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.049
You will not go through detail in each of them.

116
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.380
But once you understand the basics and foundation based on your project work,

117
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.850
you will be able to go through it in detail later on and apply and use it.

118
00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:24.809
Four,

119
00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:29.299
everything comes down to improving productivity and your efficiency.

120
00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:33.190
We have done more than 100 pilots in quarter one

121
00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:37.660
and the objective of the pilots was to understand what is

122
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.459
the applicability of JA I on our day to day work.

123
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.910
Uh once it is applied, what is the productivity improvement,

124
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.769
we will be able to get out of that

125
00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:50.809
and then going back and revising our productivity guidelines

126
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.970
which has already been revised for application maintenance,

127
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.450
infrastructure, engineering

128
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.850
and si custom and si platforms is coming up soon

129
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.100
now that the productivity guidelines have been revised every new contract,

130
00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:06.260
every new deal that we are working on

131
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:08.450
will have JA I Embedded

132
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.160
and it will come with an incremental productivity.

133
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.220
On top of what we used to offer earlier,

134
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.500
even our existing engagements with clients existing contracts.

135
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.420
We have already started discussions with clients on

136
00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:23.700
getting to the next step of applying JA I automation.

137
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.410
So what are you required to do?

138
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.609
You have to gain experience on what are the it use cases using the accenture assets

139
00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:35.540
and understand how these can help you improve the productivity.

140
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.220
And finally,

141
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.070
once you take what will be the takeaway when you go back to your projects,

142
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.799
the expectations are very high.

143
00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:47.140
If we don't do this, now, somebody else will do it and grab the work.

144
00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:52.220
It is expected that accenture being the leader in the

145
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.140
entire

146
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.140
landscape,

147
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.220
we will be applying this now and proactively taking this to our clients.

148
00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:01.380
So you have to get ready to identify the

149
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.019
A I and JA I automation opportunities within your work

150
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.510
and start on the automation journey in your own engagements.

151
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:11.890
Don't expect anybody from outside or a central

152
00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:14.059
team will come and implement anything for you.

153
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.790
The central team is here to enable you on how to adopt,

154
00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:19.869
how to apply how to use the assets.

155
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.790
But you have to figure out what are the use

156
00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:26.510
cases and start the journey on your own engagements.

157
00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:31.899
So that's the expectation from all of you with that. I wish you a very happy learning,

158
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.340
enjoy the continuous learning and keep that throughout the year.
