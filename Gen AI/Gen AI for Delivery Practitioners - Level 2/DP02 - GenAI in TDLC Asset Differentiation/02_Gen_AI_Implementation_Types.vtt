0
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.399
This is exactly what is our offering, right?

1
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.940
See if you see this A is ecosystem based in a implementation.

2
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.159
So whether we use our products, which is Gen Wizard or Gen Light

3
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.120
A is must

4
00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:32.029
you have to have a which is your ecosystem, you know,

5
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.950
tools and partnerships without that B and C will not work, right?

6
00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:36.200
So this is very, very important

7
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.360
when you're talking about ecosystem tools, there are multiple different

8
00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:41.990
types of ecosystem tools and partnership.

9
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.069
So the first thing is foundation models, right?

10
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.849
You absolutely need a foundation model, right?

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.599
Because whether it is A is A is a GP T we use Azure

12
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.009
opening. So most of our pilots, all of our pilots in TDLC.

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.750
So far we have actually done it through,

14
00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.639
we have used GP T 3.5 and four through the

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.990
Azure Open Air Services, right?

16
00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.729
But there are so many others like Lama

17
00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.129
Cohere, like for oracle, I think they have tied it with Cohere.

18
00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:09.529
So there are a number of foundation models, I mean, going forward,

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.819
this will be very much democratized, right?

20
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.610
So, so since the

21
00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:12.800
Azure

22
00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:13.029
Open,

23
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.330
I most of my clients also use it

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.180
a lot of clients are also started moving to Google,

25
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.330
most of these models will give you more or less similar kind of output, right?

26
00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:25.650
So, so obviously, as your opinion, you see the uh outcomes are quite, quite,

27
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.040
quite good, quite, you know, I mean, significantly um uh better.

28
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.260
But I think with the time most there will be not very few differences between the

29
00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:35.254
models that you choose going forward.

30
00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:38.464
So this obviously you need that because this is your uh you know,

31
00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:41.394
the pre trained transformation, you know transformative model,

32
00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:43.944
which basically we you know trained with a lot

33
00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:46.794
of huge amount of information across your open internet,

34
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.925
which will help you give a lot of information.

35
00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:50.995
So these are based foundation models, you absolutely need.

36
00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:52.580
The second one is the j

37
00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:53.930
specific tools

38
00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:55.599
like you know, someone who was talking about

39
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.389
github Copilot from Microsoft, right? Aws

40
00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:00.680
uh is you know Aws Cosper

41
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.239
and then you have those tab nine so many Juul is coming again in Sap, right?

42
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.080
So

43
00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.559
that is also very important, right? So for example, we have not

44
00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.289
create something which can generate code because there

45
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.750
is no point in doing that because the

46
00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.929
github

47
00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.080
copilot of the world will actually generate

48
00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.960
code for different technologies much better.

49
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.429
So we need to, we have used that to integrate to our,

50
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.009
you know, to our platform,

51
00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:24.509
you you need to use that

52
00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.750
and then the other partners of choice like your

53
00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.729
basic tools which you already know like your service.

54
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.149
Now,

55
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.029
uh the monitoring tools that the client have the Jira of the worlds plan, all of that.

56
00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.779
So this is absolutely unique.

57
00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.350
And then what we do

58
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.350
you integrate these tools and the ecosystem tools

59
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.789
in a very microservice way to our platform because

60
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.139
to build something which a will not give you, right?

61
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.350
So a will give you only very specific use cases.

62
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.169
But our differentiation is always end to end whether you talk

63
00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.979
about the application maintenance, infrastructure maintenance,

64
00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.679
you know your green field, brown field,

65
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.800
it should impact gen A should impact every aspect of your life cycle of TDLC.

66
00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.279
So to do that, you need more than just A

67
00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.500
and that's where our gen wizard comes in option B, right? So,

68
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.369
so the Gen wizard is again our

69
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.389
core platform, right?

70
00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.710
It's again for all of you gen wizard is not just my wizard

71
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.910
with Genia is equal to Gen wizard. It's not that though the name sounds similar,

72
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.410
you know, similar my wizard to gen wizard,

73
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.339
the gen wizard is basically built on

74
00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.119
all of our below. The gen wizard is all of our intelligent

75
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.669
uh you know, automation and predictive A I assets across all of our platforms,

76
00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:34.839
not just my wizard, right?

77
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.380
My wizard may

78
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.869
have my concerto all of that.

79
00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.820
So we had huge investments, we had a lot of differentiators,

80
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.360
we of course we wanted to use, you know, we have leveraged that

81
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.940
And then on top of that, we have actually plugged in gen

82
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.139
I right? When you plugged in Je I, it basically means there are use cases,

83
00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.419
the earlier predictive

84
00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:55.000
use cases, their efficacy is now increased significantly with J

85
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.139
I

86
00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.240
that is one set of use cases.

87
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.759
The other set of use cases are completely new use

88
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.350
cases like your reverse engineering code and you know,

89
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.250
building that enterprise knowledge base with much more new new things,

90
00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:06.550
which was not possible earlier.

91
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.399
So, so those are what I'm talking about.

92
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.669
So all of these put together is basically your gen wizard.

93
00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.009
So the gen wizard is a combination of A plus B.

94
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.920
Now the third option is the Gen Light. You have also heard about our two offerings.

95
00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:19.160
One is Gen Wizard and Gen Light.

96
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.589
The Jin Light is basically an open source inspired option. So what do you mean by that

97
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.070
Gen Wizard is a platform implementation?

98
00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:28.470
Gen Li

99
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.070
is basically working co working with the client

100
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:34.579
to build custom solutions for that particular client.

101
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.750
So what happens in? So JL currently is available on

102
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.220
um you know, application development only not for application maintenance.

103
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.230
So here basically for example,

104
00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.920
and the option to choose between B and C is very simple

105
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.839
is the client

106
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.890
OK. With accenture IP,

107
00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:54.119
if the answer is yes,

108
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.440
then you choose

109
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.350
P

110
00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:59.880
B means A plus B that you choose that client ecosystem,

111
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.350
our client ecosystem partnerships,

112
00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:04.109
the clients invested ecosystem partnerships plus the gen wiser.

113
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.149
If the client is absolutely not OK.

114
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.359
With a vendor IP, then you choose A is common and then you choose the Gen light option.

115
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.380
So the gen light option, why you are calling it a private open source.

116
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.239
It is a building in progress. So our philosophy is that

117
00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:23.109
once you build like a custom applications, let's say for 10 clients, correct?

118
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.049
I can then understand a lot of patterns, right?

119
00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.399
So I can harvest those patterns, those uh you know those prompts,

120
00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:33.450
those code snippet everything in a private open source model.

121
00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:35.200
I think someone just asked me that question, right?

122
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:38.670
So I don't want to uh go to the open A I see, for example, github,

123
00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:39.200
github

124
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.369
copilot, you can generate code,

125
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.149
you can generate code in two ways. If you use, you

126
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.510
have co

127
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.619
plot as an enterprise option where you have fed only the enterprise,

128
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.170
your own enterprise code

129
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.730
and you can actually save, you

130
00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:52.109
have co

131
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.630
plot not to generate code from the open internet.

132
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.149
There is an option there.

133
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.559
So similarly,

134
00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:59.529
if we don't want to generate code from the

135
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.869
open uh you know internet and have more control,

136
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.489
which what we have built, this is the option of the Gen light.

137
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.940
So where basically the idea is that we'll create an accenture private open source

138
00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.269
and we will learn from,

139
00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:15.000
right. So, so when you are building the custom um implementations for a client

140
00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:18.570
that will really help you to kind of understand from your uh you know,

141
00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:23.309
created pattern harvested patterns of uh prompts and libraries and all of that.

142
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.519
So that's the difference between B plus C

143
00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:28.630
I will also come for the other differences.

144
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.410
But that is very important for all of you to know.

145
00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.890
And the second is when you're talking about gen wizard, of course,

146
00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.899
you know, there are multiple commercial models again

147
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.559
for our manage services contract. As you know,

148
00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:41.600
we will use the

149
00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:45.980
wizard to commit the significantly higher productivity commitment that we do,

150
00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:46.600
correct.

151
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.059
But if the client wants to use it beyond

152
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.079
our accenture scope of work for an enterprise applications,

153
00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.059
which quite a few clients are now discussing,

154
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.790
obviously, there will be a concept of

155
00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:59.549
license fee and all of that, right? So, so enterprise license and all of that

156
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.779
in this in this third option, Gen light,

157
00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:03.980
there is no

158
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.540
IP in the sense that I think this is still evolving

159
00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.130
because you are building custom code for the client.

160
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:12.380
So obviously, the IP remains with client, right?

161
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.459
So you are you are you are building this in the client environment,

162
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.609
uh you know, using clients,

163
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.040
security architecture and and and and the whatever the tools of

164
00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:24.579
choice that the client have and you're co building it.

165
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.540
So obviously, you know,

166
00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:27.760
this will take more time to build than

167
00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:30.260
gen wizard because this is a complete platform,

168
00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:31.239
as I said, you right,

169
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.739
this is a reference and the IP remains with the client here in option C in gen light.

170
00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:39.679
But the thing is that in even in gen light option, we are not giving the code access.

171
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.589
For example, we are building the code for the client,

172
00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:43.920
we will not give

173
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.329
code access. So what happens is that clients will be able to use it?

174
00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:51.690
They don't have to pay any IP to us, but going forward if they want to make any changes,

175
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.850
upgrades, etcetera, you know,

176
00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:55.019
enhancements to the existing to the application

177
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:56.200
which we have built through gen light,

178
00:07:56.299 --> 00:08:00.760
they will again have to come to us and then you know, how do we kind of charge them?

179
00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:03.660
We are still kind of discussing. So that's basically a

180
00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:05.369
difference between gen wizard and gen X.
