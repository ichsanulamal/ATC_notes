# Redefining New Ways of Delivery

## Key Concepts

1. **Value Chain Transformation**  
   - Gen AI will disrupt and reimagine the entire value chain of clients, impacting processes across the board.
   - Engage in conversations with clients to simplify the narrative around redefining delivery methods.

2. **Current State Challenges**  
   - Many clients face data silos, legacy systems, and inefficiencies due to inorganic growth through acquisitions.
   - Common IT issues include interoperability problems and outdated tools across various lines of business.

3. **Target State Goals**  
   - Aim for simplified processes and systems with a clean digital core.
   - Build a foundation that leverages AI and data to enhance efficiency and drive transformation.

4. **Transformative Technologies**  
   - Generative AI (Gen AI) is a game-changer that allows for a streamlined transition from current to target states.
   - Emphasize the importance of integrating Gen AI into workflows to improve efficiency and knowledge sharing.

## Five Transformative Steps

### 1. Knowledge Creation
- Develop a **living enterprise knowledge base** that includes:
  - Traditional knowledge sources (SOPs, incident reports).
  - Implicit knowledge from subject matter experts (captured from service desk interactions).
  - Code-derived knowledge (reverse engineering applications into understandable documents).

### 2. Hyper Automation
- Implement broader automation strategies using Gen AI:
  - Generate automation scripts from existing code.
  - Enhance root cause analysis by enriching service requests with contextual knowledge.
  - Empower junior team members with accessible enterprise knowledge, reducing reliance on senior staff.

### 3. Tech Debt Reduction
- Utilize Gen AI for:
  - Change impact analysis by understanding code dependencies and generating recommendations.
  - Automating test case creation for new changes, facilitating quicker updates and improvements.

### 4. Accelerated Business Reinvention
- Improve the software engineering lifecycle:
  - Integrate user story generation, design documentation, and automated resource provisioning.
  - Streamline processes from requirements to deployment, significantly increasing speed to market.

### 5. Future-Ready Systems
- Encourage **micro transformations** over large-scale projects:
  - Focus on incremental improvements (e.g., modernizing specific business processes) rather than comprehensive overhauls.
  - Leverage savings from previous steps to fund these transformations, demonstrating value incrementally.

## Conclusion
These five steps collectively redefine how clients can transform their IT landscape. Each client's needs will vary, and this framework provides a complementary approach to achieve their goals effectively. 

By emphasizing the integration of Gen AI and focusing on micro transformations, organizations can navigate the complexities of modern IT environments while maximizing efficiency and value delivery.

# Gen AI Implementation Types

## Overview of Offerings

1. **Ecosystem Foundation**
   - Essential for implementation success.
   - Tools and partnerships are critical for effective solutions.

2. **Foundation Models**
   - Necessary for generating outputs.
   - Examples: GPT (via Azure OpenAI), Llama, Cohere, Oracle's Cohere.
   - Models provide similar results; ongoing democratization expected.
   - Use cases include large-scale information processing and transformation.

3. **Specific Tools**
   - Examples include:
     - GitHub Copilot (Microsoft)
     - AWS CodeWhisperer
     - Tabnine
   - These tools enhance code generation and should be integrated into existing platforms.

4. **Gen Wizard**
   - Core platform for intelligent automation and predictive AI.
   - Combines various AI assets across all platforms, not limited to MyWizard.
   - Enhances existing predictive use cases and introduces new capabilities like reverse engineering and knowledge base building.

5. **Gen Light**
   - Open-source inspired solution for custom client implementations.
   - Currently focused on application development, not maintenance.
   - Differentiates based on client preferences for IP:
     - If clients accept Accenture IP, they choose Gen Wizard (A + B).
     - If not, they select Gen Light (A + C).

6. **IP and Licensing**
   - In Gen Wizard, higher productivity commitments are made under managed services contracts, with potential licensing fees for broader enterprise applications.
   - In Gen Light, custom-built solutions keep IP with the client, but clients cannot access the underlying code.
   - Future modifications or enhancements require collaboration with Accenture.

## Key Takeaways
- A successful Gen AI implementation relies on a robust ecosystem of foundation models and specific tools.
- Gen Wizard offers comprehensive AI capabilities, while Gen Light provides a tailored, client-specific approach.
- Understanding the implications of IP and licensing is crucial for both offerings.
