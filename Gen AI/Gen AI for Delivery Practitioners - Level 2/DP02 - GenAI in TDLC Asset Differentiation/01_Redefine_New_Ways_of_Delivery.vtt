00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.340
Gen I is real and it's going to reimagine the most

1
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.829
part of your the entire value chain of your clients,

2
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.989
right?

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.170
So whether we are focusing the entire value chain of TDLC, uh these two days,

4
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.030
the entire value chain

5
00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:27.780
will disrupt and it will reimagine basically the way

6
00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:29.729
uh we typically used to do work.

7
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.770
So what I will do is that, you know, let's start with

8
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.029
the messaging that we are giving to the clients, right?

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.590
Because all of you are expected now to have these conversations with your clients

10
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.770
and simplifying it

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.590
and more showing through examples and how actually we tell the narrative to

12
00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:50.250
the clients that what do you mean by redefining new ways of delivery?

13
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:51.430
Right? So how it will happen?

14
00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:53.009
So that's the narrative,

15
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.110
what we have built it and we have kind of uh this is what we kind of show and tell

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.290
uh the clients on the CX Os, right? So we have met like around more than uh

17
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.339
probably 200 CX Os in the last 34 months.

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.150
And this end to end differentiated journey,

19
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.779
like everybody is doing something on gen

20
00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.995
I, so many of our clients have also established J AC OE as you know, right.

21
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.724
So there are so many partner products,

22
00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:15.875
giap

23
00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.845
co pilots of the world and, and AWS code, you know,

24
00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:22.605
Code Whisper and so many other products and so many foundation models also,

25
00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:23.595
right when we started

26
00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:26.925
and every, every now and then there are new foundation models.

27
00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.714
So how do you make sense of it?

28
00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:32.264
Um And where basically our accenture differentiation

29
00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.004
is actually synergize with the clients,

30
00:01:34.014 --> 00:01:34.175
right?

31
00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:37.245
So that's the journey that's, that's probably the narrative first, let us discuss

32
00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:39.300
and then let's have a question and then

33
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.650
you will have a lot of peeling of the onions in the next

34
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.930
two days to understand the nitty gritties of the entire uh narrative,

35
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.150
right?

36
00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.500
So if you see that, right? So this current state,

37
00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.489
this is all uh you, you, we all know, right?

38
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.660
So, so every of the uh most of the clients uh ecosystem it stack uh you know,

39
00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:58.339
it kind of represent this, right?

40
00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.970
So which basically means there are a lot of data silos,

41
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.620
uh most of our clients have grown uh inorganically by acquisition.

42
00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:05.660
So there's a lot of legacy,

43
00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:10.220
take overlap of tools in multiple different lines of business, right?

44
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.460
Um So a lot of inoperative ability and uh you know, the problems,

45
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.690
those are the common problems in any of the it world of, of our clients.

46
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.759
Now the target state is where everybody want to go, right?

47
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.729
So how can you simplify the processes, how can you simplify the system, have a clean

48
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.000
digital core?

49
00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:28.089
Uh then you can you know,

50
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.509
build the power of A I data cloud all of that on top of that to kind of build efficiency.

51
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.330
So how you get to this target state?

52
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.529
And that's why if you all remember last couple of years, right?

53
00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.449
So we have so many narratives in accenture, right?

54
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.929
So we had uh the living systems and narrative,

55
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.800
the the uh tech enterprise reinvention narrative run to new narrative, all of that,

56
00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.960
right?

57
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.169
So all of that is basically to tell that narrative that how we can help the client in

58
00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.630
compress transformation in moving from current state to the

59
00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.710
target state faster better uh in a seamless way.

60
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.009
Now, you know the most

61
00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.309
impacting

62
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.690
technology, right? The JA I, with the advent of JA, I

63
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.550
think this is the most powerful technology ever

64
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.470
where where actually we can tell the client that with this,

65
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.869
we can really help you to kind of do this from the current state to target state.

66
00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:19.770
And and if you see this,

67
00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.490
you will see these slides a lot more and you should

68
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.940
use these slides a lot more and the demos behind that,

69
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:24.089
right?

70
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.320
To kind of uh tell um uh how we can simplify things for our client.

71
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.899
So these are the five steps,

72
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.699
what we have kind of synthesized based on all our learnings

73
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.589
and what we have done that how really in TDL CJ,

74
00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.199
I can

75
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.289
make that transformative changes for our clients.

76
00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.580
See the first one if you see

77
00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.309
knowledge.

78
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.729
So here, what we are telling is that

79
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.550
creating your living enterprise knowledge for our clients?

80
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.500
And were we not doing that earlier?

81
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.830
But the way we were doing earlier and now it's a completely,

82
00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.070
completely different way of doing things, right?

83
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.990
So earlier, when we're talking about knowledge, we used to say about that,

84
00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.339
how we can digitize your work flows in a tool.

85
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.649
So how we can you know, harvest uh the complex uh flows of, of, of,

86
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.350
of a solution or a problem solving into a digitized

87
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.199
format so that people can kind of use it easily.

88
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.100
But now there are three paradigm shift in the

89
00:04:17.108 --> 00:04:19.709
enterprise knowledge that what we can actually do through

90
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.130
a

91
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.589
point. A

92
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.149
all your traditional sources of knowledge

93
00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:27.089
can be part of that knowledge base, right,

94
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.179
which we are calling it in the uh in the terminology

95
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.109
as we'll talk about the vector database and all of that.

96
00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:33.609
But, but to simplify things that

97
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.309
the traditional sources of knowledge, what do you mean by that?

98
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.359
So all your

99
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.239
sops that you are generating all your

100
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.809
uh you know, the incident reports, your uh problem investigation reports,

101
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.059
uh your batch reports, your business processes analysis,

102
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.959
if you're doing it for your clients, right?

103
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.829
So all of those traditional sources of knowledge

104
00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:55.320
is, is part of this point A

105
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.380
point B is all your implicit knowledge that

106
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.070
is there in your sme s,

107
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.390
how do we capture that earlier? It was very difficult to capture.

108
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.390
Now, for example, let's say an end user calls the service desk for A P one incident,

109
00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.709
right?

110
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.470
Those calls typically gets recorded in something like AWS

111
00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.250
connect, right?

112
00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:17.600
Imagine and, and all of those calls that gets,

113
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.920
gets recorded or your P one bridge calls that get recorded, right?

114
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:23.040
So that has plethora of

115
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.130
tapped knowledge inside that, right?

116
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.019
Because you are discussing systems, you are discussing the root cause analysis,

117
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.149
you are discussing the flow of the data and then

118
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.950
you are trying to basically come up with a solution,

119
00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:32.089
right?

120
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.059
So all of those tapped knowledge in those recordings,

121
00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:39.200
you know, can be summarized now very, very, you know,

122
00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.410
beautifully by generative with a high degree of efficiency

123
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.350
and that can be your party for knowledge base,

124
00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:44.640
which

125
00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:48.450
was not able to, you know, contextualizing that that is point B

126
00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:50.519
point C which was

127
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.709
the game changer,

128
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.480
which was absolutely not possible at is basically

129
00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:56.079
the knowledge you get from the code.

130
00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.119
So for example, you know, we inherit a lot of applications,

131
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.320
we take over a lot of applications for a new deal and then support that right?

132
00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:03.899
In terms of maintaining that or in

133
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.179
terms of bringing continuous enhancements in those,

134
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.019
that's what we do, right?

135
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.390
So in our A MS word

136
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:10.190
and, and, and I MS Word,

137
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.529
imagine that if you can

138
00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:13.910
reverse engineer their applications.

139
00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:17.190
And that entire complexity of code

140
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.750
can be now

141
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.820
synthesized into a simple English documents.

142
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.709
In terms of your you know, I can have code explanation in simple English,

143
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.339
I can derive I can create your you know,

144
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.779
the user stories in simple English that what is the features and what

145
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.309
are the user stories that comprise this

146
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.230
entire application which I'm reverse engineering?

147
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.040
What is the you know, test scripts?

148
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.250
What is the test cases to test these U user stories, right?

149
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.500
Which builds this application.

150
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.980
So that entire now of complex application is basically can be

151
00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:51.100
reverse reverse engineered into a complete set of English documents,

152
00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:51.470
right?

153
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.130
Which is readable, understandable. Anyone can understand

154
00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:57.049
that goes into your knowledge base as well.

155
00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:02.600
Now with that, imagine if you put AJ A I enabled chat interface on top of that,

156
00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:05.390
how you know transformative is that chat interface

157
00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.149
compared to what we used to earlier?

158
00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:11.049
Now if you remember earlier, also last 34 years, there was a lot of A I based chatbots,

159
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.519
but still there were a lot of uh I mean there

160
00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:16.239
was not that seamless human experience in most of them,

161
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.440
right?

162
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.040
Because then that's where if you had seen

163
00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:21.059
the adaptability of those chat boards were not

164
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.019
very high because they always used to,

165
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:23.450
you know,

166
00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.010
look for some of the specific words in your questions or intent based on that.

167
00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:29.390
It would it used to go to FA

168
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.750
Q and give you the answers.

169
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.079
But here the contextualizing is so much broader and deeper

170
00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:37.040
because of all these three things that I told you,

171
00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:37.239
right?

172
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.299
So so much of information now goes there.

173
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.260
So now in the chat interface,

174
00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:45.179
if you're an L two or an L three engineer from a TDLC perspective, I am saying, right,

175
00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.980
I can ask a technical question. I think that

176
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:48.510
you know how,

177
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.279
how the data is flowing from these applications and

178
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.529
and what are the typical problem segments of,

179
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.850
you know, the order not getting processed?

180
00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:55.549
For example,

181
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.559
or it will actually contextualizing and give you a lot better, you know,

182
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.260
richer information because of the how we have set up this knowledge base.

183
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:06.589
Imagine a business user who, who has a business problems

184
00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.029
and to answer that business problem now,

185
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.829
I mean,

186
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.869
it can actually contextualize what is written in your code, right?

187
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.790
If it does not find the information in your service now take or the other sops,

188
00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:20.410
it can actually go through all the reverse engineered code, right?

189
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.309
Because your code,

190
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.799
your business logic will be there in the code that

191
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:26.079
you have rivers engineered into a set of English documents.

192
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:29.010
It will just go through that and we'll be able to answer you that quickly

193
00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:32.229
so that efficacy will be significantly higher.

194
00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:35.090
So that basically is a game changer and the clients

195
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.969
really love it because if you see current client problems,

196
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.000
they have given their outsourcing work to so many different vendors

197
00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.700
and, and and over a period of time, most of the clients,

198
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.109
they have lost their ability of,

199
00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.599
of the knowledge of their own business processes because

200
00:08:47.609 --> 00:08:50.000
it is now supported by so many vendor applications.

201
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.909
Now, once you build this,

202
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.919
then it becomes like a, you know,

203
00:08:53.929 --> 00:08:57.989
such a powerful sources of information and knowledge and wisdom.

204
00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.669
That's the first point of it.

205
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.250
The second point, the second aspect is your hyper

206
00:09:03.489 --> 00:09:04.590
automation. So the hyper

207
00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:06.400
automation is the step change.

208
00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:09.090
It's not a game changer because we used to do a lot of hyper automation

209
00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:12.739
as well, right? Using our uh intelligent automation rps,

210
00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:12.919
uh

211
00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:14.960
predictive I assets, all of that.

212
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.109
But with J

213
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.109
what happens

214
00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:19.960
we can do it much broader and faster.

215
00:09:19.969 --> 00:09:22.530
So for example, a lot of those automation scripts

216
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.609
you can generate directly from your code

217
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:26.590
generation engine like your github Copilot,

218
00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:27.159
right?

219
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.200
You don't have to write everything from, from scratch.

220
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.070
Uh

221
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.609
you can generate workflows, right?

222
00:09:33.619 --> 00:09:36.650
So how to solve a particular type of problems, right?

223
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.320
What are the different types of work flows?

224
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.530
You can use it by taking the part of your foundation models and the knowledge,

225
00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:46.580
client context, knowledge, uh enterprise knowledge that you are creating, right?

226
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.049
You you will be able to do root cause analysis much better because for example,

227
00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:54.609
for a service now ticket, you will not have so much of information, right?

228
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.289
But you can add additional information into your

229
00:09:57.434 --> 00:09:59.205
request for a service. Now, tickets

230
00:09:59.554 --> 00:10:01.474
by doing the contextualization

231
00:10:01.614 --> 00:10:04.594
of so many things that are already there in a knowledge base.

232
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:08.174
So your ability to solve tickets will be much faster.

233
00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:08.844
You know,

234
00:10:08.854 --> 00:10:13.645
the junior person in the team also does not have to in the previous way of working.

235
00:10:13.664 --> 00:10:16.474
A lot of times they had to wait for the senior guys to help them out,

236
00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:18.554
not required because you are actually now you know,

237
00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:20.994
taking the help of your enterprise knowledge base and and all of

238
00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:24.164
these technologies to get kind of do the things much more faster.

239
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.409
Now 345 again is is a huge transformative changes which was hard, not possible.

240
00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:31.950
So take debt reduction through

241
00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:33.200
zero text

242
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:33.460
earlier,

243
00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:37.159
we always used to talk about tech debt reduction but now it is like really real,

244
00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:37.950
you can see it.

245
00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:39.950
So what happens to gen I is that

246
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.640
you can actually do your change impact in analysis.

247
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.780
So you can reverse engineer code. I said that right?

248
00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:46.840
And you can generate a lot of the English language.

249
00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:47.580
Now

250
00:10:48.599 --> 00:10:52.030
there is a new change that you have to put in in your uh that application code, right?

251
00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:54.210
So a change request is coming now the J I

252
00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:57.929
will be able to understand the change request uh context

253
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.640
and since it has already reverse engineered everything

254
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.619
and it has also created a topology right?

255
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.640
Connecting your,

256
00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:08.020
you know, connecting your methods and functions to you know, the underlying

257
00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:08.684
clear

258
00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:09.924
and all of that, right?

259
00:11:10.065 --> 00:11:13.414
It will be able to, it will give you a recommendation that which are the different

260
00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:17.125
code files that will get changed because of these changes,

261
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.474
it will even recommend the snippets of code.

262
00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:23.145
For those changes, it will generate the new, you know,

263
00:11:23.155 --> 00:11:27.484
the the test script or the test cases that you need to even test that new change.

264
00:11:28.049 --> 00:11:29.669
So that is again a game changer, right?

265
00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:30.159
And of course,

266
00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:32.989
in every one of the steps you need to have human loop because

267
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.580
for everything in a you need a human loop to basically validate things

268
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.520
but things will be so much faster, right?

269
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.039
And we have and all of these 0.12345 we have done pilots,

270
00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:46.429
many of those use cases are already in production in some of the clients.

271
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.465
So we have seen real, right?

272
00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.835
So for example, in just three months of pilot,

273
00:11:50.844 --> 00:11:55.265
we have seen around 10 to 15% of productivity improvement in many clients, imagine.

274
00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:58.304
And when you can do this for your five years contract, right?

275
00:11:58.315 --> 00:12:00.215
From beginning, if you can really think through it,

276
00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:00.825
I mean,

277
00:12:00.835 --> 00:12:02.864
you can do really like wonders um

278
00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:04.825
by understanding those client processes and everything.

279
00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:07.505
The fourth is accelerated business reinvention. So what is that?

280
00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:10.695
It is all about your forward engineering use cases, right?

281
00:12:10.705 --> 00:12:13.145
So for example, when you are building something,

282
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.260
so as a

283
00:12:14.409 --> 00:12:15.419
he was mentioning, right?

284
00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:16.450
So the so github,

285
00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:20.030
co pilots of the world and and the other code recommended engines,

286
00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:23.340
they are mainly focused on generating code and generating unit cases, right?

287
00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:24.549
So and code explanation,

288
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.289
but your software engineering is everything right.

289
00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:30.500
So right from how do you do requirements, how do you write user stories?

290
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.049
How do you write design documents?

291
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.940
So this business accelerated reinvention is nothing about.

292
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.150
So we have through our platform now

293
00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:38.179
we have

294
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.289
connected the dots from

295
00:12:40.909 --> 00:12:42.750
tenter software engineering life cycle.

296
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.520
So right from generating the user stories to qualify the quality

297
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.380
of those user stories to generation of the design document,

298
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.780
your functional, you know, application architecture, functional architecture,

299
00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:55.130
technology architecture,

300
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.780
once you build the technology architecture, provisioning those environments

301
00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:02.806
and the resources automatically using C ID pipelines, right?

302
00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:06.426
Then your entire test management, your code generation, your test management,

303
00:13:06.435 --> 00:13:09.406
creating test data, creating boilerplates to deploy.

304
00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:12.375
So in every phase of your software engineering, if you are,

305
00:13:12.385 --> 00:13:14.705
if you are kind of building applications

306
00:13:14.866 --> 00:13:15.366
generative,

307
00:13:15.515 --> 00:13:19.581
I will help you to do it better faster. So the so the that trans

308
00:13:19.731 --> 00:13:22.221
that that compressed transformation which we all

309
00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:23.492
kind of been talking in accenture,

310
00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:23.872
right?

311
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.721
You can really do that

312
00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:30.132
uh you know like really faster and and and your speed of value,

313
00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:33.421
the speed to market and speed to value both will increase significantly, right?

314
00:13:33.432 --> 00:13:35.081
So that's about the accelerated business

315
00:13:35.202 --> 00:13:39.081
convention. And the last but not the least when we say build future ready system,

316
00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:43.059
we will be able to do that now much better because see

317
00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:48.109
this is again, very powerful. So a lot of clients were going and are going

318
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.849
big transformation programs, right?

319
00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:52.369
But if you see the macroeconomic situation now,

320
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.609
very few clients are willing to do a large transformation program, right? Because

321
00:13:56.809 --> 00:14:00.130
um it's, it's it's a lot of changes, right? And, and, and a lot of money.

322
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.130
But now what we can say through ja I

323
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.119
to the client that instead of big transformation,

324
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.390
we can help you through a series of micro transformations.

325
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.960
And what I mean by that,

326
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.559
you know, the savings that you can do through all of these top four, right?

327
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.250
Actually can be helping a self funded series of micro transformation.

328
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.000
So, so for example, let's take that I really,

329
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.609
the client really want to modernize their applications.

330
00:14:23.859 --> 00:14:26.479
We will say that OK, let's take piecemeal, right?

331
00:14:26.489 --> 00:14:28.409
Let's take one of your critical business process.

332
00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:29.880
For example, let's say supply chain,

333
00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:32.520
let's look at the uh application

334
00:14:33.609 --> 00:14:34.440
stack

335
00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:35.210
and

336
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.299
the

337
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.000
now instead of completely doing a rela

338
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.309
you know, and reimagining your everything together,

339
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.820
we can do PP we can say that let's focus only from your front end.

340
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.390
So if you have, if you're using a client is using, let's say oracle forms, right?

341
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.750
If I have to need those change that to let's say a modern technology like angular,

342
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.539
which is much more nimble, user friendly and, and, and, and you know,

343
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.590
we can actually do only that part of it

344
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.619
show the value to the client,

345
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.190
then you take the next series of transformations.

346
00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:09.289
So now with the gen I,

347
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:11.140
we will be able to actually then do this

348
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.849
series of micro transformation instead of a Big Bang approach

349
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.190
and all this narrative, right? Combination of this 1 to 5, if you look at it

350
00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:22.479
is going to reimagine completely the way the clients really you know,

351
00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:25.219
are looking at it to kind of change the right it

352
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.570
state and bring the value to it.

353
00:15:26.869 --> 00:15:29.539
Now, will every client need all these five steps?

354
00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:31.390
No, but this narrative is very,

355
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.830
very important because these are very very complementary

356
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.409
and work cohesively with each other each other.

357
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.969
Now, you know, a lot of our CX, for example, looking at different things.

358
00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:42.690
So one of the client like they're looking at knowledge as a service.

359
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.409
So they really love this concept of of this enterprise knowledge services, right?

360
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.299
So another client like Dell, which is a tech company, right?

361
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:51.150
So they are so excited,

362
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:55.989
they are looking at kind of discussing at an enterprise uh option of our, you know,

363
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.820
our platform

364
00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.859
to basically they want to mainly use it as a migration as a service, right?

365
00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:03.099
Which basically they have a lot of legacy tech stack.

366
00:16:03.109 --> 00:16:05.099
They want to kind of see, you know, in, in, in,

367
00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:09.840
in c quite quickly want to kind of reimagine those legacy to

368
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.250
our modern technology.

369
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.780
So there are like whole gamut of discussions that we are doing it through plan.
