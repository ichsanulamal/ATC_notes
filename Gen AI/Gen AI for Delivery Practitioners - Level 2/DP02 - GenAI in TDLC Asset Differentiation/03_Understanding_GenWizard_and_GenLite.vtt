WEBVTT

0
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.770
Now deep diving on the gen

1
00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:18.370
wizard

2
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.479
which is option B which is a full suit end to end automation platform.

3
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.840
So it's like it's a full fledged product or platform available.

4
00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:27.459
It caters to

5
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.159
use cases across the technology, deliver life cycles.

6
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.099
As we have already seen, it comes with 350 plus patented assets

7
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.119
ready to use in the platform.

8
00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:40.240
It is secured.

9
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.330
It is

10
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:42.330
uh

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.729
all these compliances,

12
00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:47.110
uh the checks regulations, but

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.139
like the security, uh all these responsible A IE assessments,

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.490
everything is performed

15
00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:54.479
on this damage R platform,

16
00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:57.360
it is plug and play architecture

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.650
and I was talking about switchboard architecture for

18
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.650
selecting multiple LL MS like multi LLM options.

19
00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.430
So plug and play means it can integrate

20
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.410
easily with client ecosystem tools like their service.

21
00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:10.709
Now their applications, their

22
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.589
s their dynamics and all.

23
00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:18.720
It also leverages our accenture's industry process repositories like all the

24
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.209
business process documentation for 19 plus industries like let's say we have

25
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.319
our business process documentation for retail insurance, hospitality.

26
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.970
So from all these industries, we have the

27
00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.180
business process documentation from level one to level five, right?

28
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.830
So those business processes are also being harvest

29
00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:41.529
like used given as context in regenerator.

30
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.839
Um it's already built

31
00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.989
in

32
00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.569
plus since uh we can also like we can

33
00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:52.870
take clients, knowledge, clients, documentations and contextualize

34
00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:54.569
into the knowledge base.

35
00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.989
So that generative A I produces very client specific

36
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.790
uh

37
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.300
outcome and uh responses.

38
00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.629
It, it can integrate with client ecosystem tools.

39
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.479
And if you look at on the top

40
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.389
already, 150 plus use cases are already built in.

41
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.110
Now, these 150 plus use cases includes

42
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.460
A MS use application maintenance, use cases, infrastructure maintenance,

43
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.360
use cases,

44
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.580
application development, use cases, system integration,

45
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.880
use cases and data and A I use cases.

46
00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:33.039
SAP is a platform use cases oracle use cases. So these are all together in 150 plus

47
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.460
now. W why J

48
00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:37.729
is for client?

49
00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.809
If client wants to

50
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.050
jump start their generative V I journey, their automation journey through uh

51
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.639
genu

52
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.759
because the use cases are already ready,

53
00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.449
ready to use. So

54
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.070
it will be the first choice

55
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.940
like first entry point

56
00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.639
to drive this generative journey for our clients

57
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.259
provided.

58
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.059
Clients are OK.

59
00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:04.940
Uh With uh

60
00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.710
accenture's IP based software, no restriction on that, right?

61
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.869
So that that is the first entry point.

62
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.899
It has flexibility

63
00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.779
of

64
00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.460
complementing different functionalities

65
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.100
uh with respect to the generative

66
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.320
use cases in application maintenance, infrastructure maintenance,

67
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.830
application development and system integration,

68
00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.899
wide spectrum of use cases covered.

69
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.270
And also we are continuously innovating with an investment of $200 million

70
00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.490
to uh to bring more and more use cases, more and more assets

71
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.279
and also collab

72
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.729
like partner with uh ecosystem partners.

73
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.309
Like let's say we are partnering with Copilot.

74
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.130
So we are bringing more and more use

75
00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.710
cases with continuous innovation which will help client

76
00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.020
to accelerate their generative hygienic.

77
00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.199
So

78
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.279
uh why generator

79
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.929
for accenture?

80
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.970
Because we are bringing the best breed of

81
00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.929
all the platforms that 350 plus patented assets.

82
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.809
We are leveraging

83
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.220
uh which

84
00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.619
differentiates us from the other uh

85
00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:11.020
competitors.

86
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.520
The end to end automation

87
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.559
use cases across modern engineering, modern operations,

88
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.869
migrations and modernization, cloud trans migration

89
00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.119
and in the platforms like SAP and oracle uh

90
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.779
sales force and all we are working now. So our sales force work there.

91
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.380
But uh platforms

92
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.329
of Janu

93
00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:32.109
for SAP is already ready

94
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.489
uh in pilot

95
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.720
similarly oracle also

96
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.899
uh last this month,

97
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:43.140
I think it is ready, getting ready for pile flexible commercial model. But like you,

98
00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:44.160
uh Janu

99
00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:46.760
comes with 150 plus use cases,

100
00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.570
it doesn't mean that client has to buy everything or client has to use everything

101
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.510
we can implement,

102
00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:56.989
use case by use case and that will have the different commercial models.

103
00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:01.100
Uh We can uh uh client can go with

104
00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:02.339
software

105
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.760
uh service genu

106
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.279
with a different commercial or

107
00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.269
they can buy the enterprise license

108
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.799
or we can do uh uh

109
00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:15.230
uh so gain sharing model of commercial model,

110
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:16.070
right?

111
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.350
So there are different kind of commercial models,

112
00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:21.040
flexible deploy model we can have genu

113
00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.660
uh

114
00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:25.869
being deployed software is a service for client from our multi tenant

115
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.399
uh system

116
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.079
or we can take genu

117
00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:33.260
two clients cloud or clients in uh on premise

118
00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.359
or, or also we can host Genard

119
00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:36.579
in

120
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.149
dedicated uh uh environment within our accenture uh network, right?

121
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.160
So these are different deployment models that are available. Flexible is

122
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.040
and

123
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.130
we are like uh

124
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.739
since it covers

125
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.459
150 plus use cases,

126
00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:57.579
uh the the maximum coverage of use cases at

127
00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.859
speed and scale we can achieve through generator.

128
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.489
So that's on the Jan

129
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.429
Di

130
00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.799
di di di.

131
00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:06.600
Now, let's look at

132
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.809
the gen light, right?

133
00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.230
So again, as we said,

134
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.209
it is open open source inspired

135
00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:15.739
by our

136
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.529
400,000

137
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.730
software engineers, developers, testers, software engineers.

138
00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:26.829
So their contributions being harvested in the form of prompts, libraries,

139
00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.350
frameworks boards.

140
00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:30.100
And if you look at

141
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:35.709
it again, this framework also already with all this responsible A I

142
00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.239
all kind of security checks and balances.

143
00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.670
Again,

144
00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:44.700
all the open source tools used in the framework are being sanitized by accenture,

145
00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:46.839
legal and accenture L MC.

146
00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.589
And all

147
00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:50.869
it comes with two kind of versions,

148
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.410
premium person and premium person.

149
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.179
So what is premium,

150
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.309
as I said it, the gen light has to be developed,

151
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.920
leveraging our framework and best practices

152
00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:02.869
so

153
00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.510
we can develop it for our client

154
00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:08.170
and hand over to client.

155
00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:11.470
So going forward client will do the announcements,

156
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.459
fixes and everything that is premium

157
00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:14.829
and the

158
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.029
premium version is where we will develop and also with a commercial,

159
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.269
we will be able to provide them announcement support and everything going forward.

160
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.519
So these are the two versions available

161
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.429
now with respect to

162
00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:31.760
uh pre built models in the uh genu

163
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.700
like gen light, our orchestration framework.

164
00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:38.049
What does that mean? Like let's say, let's say we want to

165
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.010
develop an application and we want to

166
00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:43.250
uh leverage and light for that.

167
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.049
Now

168
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.179
we have to generate we will generate user stories.

169
00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:48.529
So we will give a prompt

170
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.619
to large language models to give general user stories.

171
00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:57.489
Then user stories will provide as input to generate architecture.

172
00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:02.339
Then architecture will provide an input to create functional design documents.

173
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.750
Functional design documents will use as an input

174
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.779
to generate technical design document and continues now

175
00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:12.510
how this input and output will be provided, right? That needs orchestration.

176
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.779
Now that orchestration framework is building already available.

177
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.260
So we can liberate that directly.

178
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.019
Similarly

179
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.059
the pre built code and prompt that already I talked about, right?

180
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.399
And also the same business processes that I told for our industries,

181
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.519
same business processes are also

182
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.369
given as a um best practices for

183
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:33.599
the

184
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.400
light it's already integrated.

185
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.679
Now, uh it's a extensive framework like let us say if client,

186
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.340
since it has to be developed for client,

187
00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:43.690
if client has their own automation platform,

188
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.840
we can leverage on that we can build on that.

189
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.020
And since it is developed for the client, we can do high level of customization

190
00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.309
based on what client wants.

191
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.190
And also any large language models can be leveraged.

192
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.309
Because if client says I am, I have already taken bedrock subscription,

193
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320
then we can develop Gen

194
00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:02.820
Light

195
00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:05.979
using bedrock, right? Or if they say I have a subscription for

196
00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:08.429
PAM, we can develop Gen light using

197
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:08.780
Pam.

198
00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:11.219
So that's kind of flexibility is there.

199
00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:13.070
Now

200
00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:15.010
it is the choice of entry

201
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.679
if client has their own existing uh uh ecos

202
00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:21.659
automation ecosystem and tooling

203
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.669
and they do not want to be logged in by exchange writing.

204
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.929
And uh

205
00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:30.469
it comes with the uh we we can augment

206
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.229
the Gen Light code base or the Gen Light

207
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:37.549
uh framework or capabilities with what clients already have

208
00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:41.320
uh their automation tools and automation platform.

209
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.030
Again,

210
00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.229
there is a continuous innovation happening in the

211
00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:46.270
gen light to bring more and more framework.

212
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.200
Currently,

213
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:47.510
Gen

214
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.039
Light is available for system integration development framework like uh use cases

215
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.010
uh again are in uh research and development and going on how we

216
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.770
can bring in the framework for

217
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.099
knowledge management framework for application maintenance,

218
00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:02.250
infrastructure maintenance.

219
00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:04.119
Now, what is there for accenture?

220
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.700
Again?

221
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.650
We are democratizing it through,

222
00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:11.729
through our 4 400,000 plus developers and testers and support engineers

223
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.330
where we are democratizing their

224
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.919
uh the usage, the prompts and all similarly uh genu

225
00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:19.760
with genu,

226
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.349
we are able to cover most of our clients but where clients are not agreeing for

227
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.929
accenture IP based Softwares. Then we we through

228
00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.229
gen light, we are able to cover more clients.

229
00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:31.229
As I said, the premium version

230
00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:33.739
is a additional revenue uh

231
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.080
with a license model that we can provide.

232
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.479
After the development,

233
00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:40.849
we can provide ongoing support and announcements

234
00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:42.789
that comes with additional revenue model.

235
00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:44.039
And uh

236
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.419
the uh if if client has a very low budget

237
00:10:47.849 --> 00:10:50.960
and only they want to implement one or two use cases,

238
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.799
their budget is very low. So string budget, very thin budget, then

239
00:10:55.169 --> 00:10:57.210
gen li it comes as a uh so

240
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.909
immediate solution where we can just uh take a

241
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.859
like any kind of a LM subscription and then

242
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.150
develop a chatbot interface and then

243
00:11:06.349 --> 00:11:08.119
give use cases to them with a lower

244
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:08.580
check.

245
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.669
So that's

246
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.690
all about the

247
00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:12.359
details of general light.

248
00:11:12.979 --> 00:11:14.140
So any questions

249
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.669
uh before I move on,

250
00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:19.710
have we seen clients start with one option and migrate to the other,

251
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.030
either based on their maturity or their pote uh potential maturity?

252
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:28.059
It is not seen yet but very it will be very unusual, right?

253
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.719
So when you say migrating from

254
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.260
general light to Jr or Jr to General light, right?

255
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.020
See the the very basic fundamental difference is that IP locking, right?

256
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.830
If client has not agreed or their,

257
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.609
their way of working is not to be logged by the

258
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.630
accenture IP S right, then

259
00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:47.200
there is no

260
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.419
chance of

261
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.380
they like if they've already gone for GEN light they,

262
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.140
they will not be agreeing for gen we

263
00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:56.309
because they are not, that is the fundamental difference they have, right?

264
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.780
They do not want to be locked in

265
00:11:57.909 --> 00:12:00.210
by the asset. So we have not seen any scenarios.

266
00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.570
And also I feel it is very unusual situation. So Pradeep

267
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:04.869
if

268
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.200
San

269
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.979
here, so if I understand right on option B right, Gen wizard plus ecosystem tool.

270
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.739
This is more of a my concern to version of

271
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.570
uh accenture. Uh is it right? Like all the assets and tools

272
00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:20.429
lying with you? There is no my concept to my

273
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.210
or my

274
00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:21.530
now

275
00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:22.390
everything is

276
00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:23.359
genu Genz

277
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.080
backbone is all those assets which are part of my

278
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.739
concerto min

279
00:12:28.099 --> 00:12:28.270
and my

280
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:28.719
wizard.

281
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.169
So now it is genu

282
00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:32.309
if clients have

283
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.719
implemented my

284
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.840
wizard or my

285
00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:35.880
concerto or my

286
00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:36.789
NAV and all

287
00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:40.330
it will be easy to implement the

288
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:40.979
understand.

289
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.909
So all the artifacts and

290
00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:45.809
things can directly be queried through the prompt.

291
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.369
The question comes if, if client doesn't have my

292
00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.979
wizard or any of this, my concept still can we use Gen

293
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.070
Wizard? Yes, because Gen

294
00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:56.559
wizard is an independent platform, it doesn't depend upon anything.

295
00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.020
It leverages these assets and all but it is independent.

296
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.640
Got it. And uh the other question comes

297
00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:03.270
if my

298
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.190
wizard is there,

299
00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:06.690
if uh if we

300
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.169
want to upgrade to Janu,

301
00:13:08.469 --> 00:13:10.960
will there be a cost or will there be any time?

302
00:13:10.969 --> 00:13:14.619
Yes, there'll be cost because we are bringing additional capabilities ll MS

303
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.820
uh additional uh hardware and all for hosting vector store and all.

304
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.140
So there'll be cost the only uh advantage it will

305
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.200
be if client has already managed a lot of approvals,

306
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.859
legal approvals, uh data security approvals and all would be there

307
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.299
only few

308
00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:33.229
uh differential approvals we need

309
00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:35.280
to uh upgrade to gen wiser.

310
00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:36.049
Uh Pretty

311
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.239
quick question. Does gen wiser still use plan platform?

312
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.260
There are multiple technologies there,

313
00:13:41.849 --> 00:13:44.760
multiple technologies. It's not only Splunk now, if it is

314
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.809
a a as a software as a service, right? It comes as a docker, right?

315
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.049
You do not need anything, it will install everything as a container, agree.

316
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.599
But where, where will you have the dashboard created?

317
00:13:53.609 --> 00:13:54.820
It will be part of the generator

318
00:13:55.049 --> 00:13:56.619
platform itself,

319
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.419
it has

320
00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.590
its own U I and all those things outcome and all you will see the demo,

321
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.729
you will do the hands on and demo of Genard.

322
00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:06.280
OK. So we'll move on. So

323
00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:07.809
whatever we talked about genu

324
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.169
Gen

325
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.679
Light, uh you if anybody asks for a very high level difference,

326
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.700
these are the difference you already we have spoken about.

327
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.250
Uh you can go through this

328
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.719
that this is more, more detailed comparison,

329
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.840
right? I want to highlight a couple of points here.

330
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:25.669
If you look at here,

331
00:14:26.169 --> 00:14:27.609
the number of use cases.

332
00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:31.010
Uh it is actually 150 plus and growing here.

333
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.059
It is 18 plus and growing because it is now available for

334
00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:40.400
uh system integration and application development uh use cases this framework,

335
00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:40.640
right?

336
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.770
The other difference I want to bring in is gen we

337
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.000
can integrate with accenture ecosystem tools like accenture service.

338
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.109
Now, accenture

339
00:14:49.219 --> 00:14:51.900
Jira and all persons and also with

340
00:14:51.909 --> 00:14:54.950
client ecosystem tools like their client service.

341
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.419
Now, client dynatrace,

342
00:14:56.539 --> 00:14:57.020
client hypo

343
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.619
dynamics. However, gen

344
00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.099
light

345
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.739
is a developed for client

346
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.070
in client environment

347
00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:03.159
and

348
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.719
client is not agreeing for accenture IPs. Hence,

349
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.210
it can only integrate with the client ecosystem tools like client service.

350
00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:11.510
Now, client Jira and all

351
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.789
that is one difference.

352
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.150
The other difference that you see is

353
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.820
the time to deploy because

354
00:15:17.989 --> 00:15:18.280
genu

355
00:15:18.609 --> 00:15:21.080
comes with ready to use use cases,

356
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:26.815
the time taken to start in implementation will be shorter than where in gen light,

357
00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:29.244
you have to develop that solution, complete solution,

358
00:15:29.255 --> 00:15:32.284
leveraging our framework and best practices, prompts and all.

359
00:15:32.294 --> 00:15:37.184
So the kind of timeline and the effort required will be a little higher.

360
00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:39.354
So these are a couple of differences.

361
00:15:39.364 --> 00:15:42.705
Uh The rest of the things we already discussed now edition

362
00:15:43.034 --> 00:15:43.325
three,

363
00:15:43.655 --> 00:15:44.815
when to use what?

364
00:15:45.284 --> 00:15:46.294
So if

365
00:15:46.484 --> 00:15:49.534
you have to come to a situation for your client

366
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.789
that you have to decide between genu

367
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:52.299
yard

368
00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:55.400
and Gen light and within genu are different hosting options,

369
00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.330
then this will be a ready made, ready made uh handy guideline for you.

370
00:16:00.549 --> 00:16:01.729
The first question is

371
00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.859
you, you, you know your client,

372
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.080
you know that whether they will be OK with the accenture IP based software,

373
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.719
if yes

374
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.179
then genu

375
00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:12.059
is the option.

376
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.400
The next question is will there be OK

377
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.590
to use software as a service genu

378
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.559
from our multi tenant cloud

379
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.919
means client is OK to share their data and all

380
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.679
into our cloud, right?

381
00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:26.729
If yes, then it is genu

382
00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:27.820
SARS model.

383
00:16:27.929 --> 00:16:31.719
The cost will be very low lowest cost because

384
00:16:31.729 --> 00:16:34.520
this is there is no additional hardware required.

385
00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:36.710
There is uh because it will be used

386
00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:39.929
software as a service from accenture in in environment

387
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.789
uh implementation will be fastest

388
00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:43.770
because

389
00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:46.609
we just need a couple of approvals, legal approval,

390
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.489
approval

391
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.690
and then uh their documentations.

392
00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:53.969
And once those are there, we'll be able to implement use cases.

393
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.510
And then uh but since it is a science

394
00:16:56.719 --> 00:17:01.130
person, we'll it is not very customers dedicated specific. Hence

395
00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:06.140
customization, client specific will be very low. Now, if they're not OK with this

396
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:06.848
a person,

397
00:17:07.218 --> 00:17:10.328
now we can have multiple hosting options.

398
00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:11.468
We can take

399
00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:11.667
Zanu

400
00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:13.318
to on prem

401
00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:14.529
or

402
00:17:14.688 --> 00:17:15.678
we can take

403
00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:19.078
Zwar to their cloud or we can have dedicated

404
00:17:19.259 --> 00:17:20.729
environment within

405
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:22.298
our Infra

406
00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:23.688
to host

407
00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:23.917
genu

408
00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:24.909
for the client.

409
00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:26.788
In all the situation,

410
00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:30.149
there will be additional cost because we need hardware,

411
00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:32.448
we need uh we need to configure

412
00:17:32.869 --> 00:17:35.859
uh all those uh um uh set ups.

413
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.170
It can be in the accenture managed cloud or it can be hosted

414
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.650
in client managed cloud elite time will be higher than this as implementation

415
00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:47.250
because all the set up approvals firewall opening

416
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.810
and all those things has to happen.

417
00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:51.410
Uh customization is to some extent possible because

418
00:17:51.959 --> 00:17:53.630
it will be client dedicated. Gen

419
00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:54.410
so

420
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.959
if client wants some kind of customization, then it it might it may be possible.

421
00:17:58.969 --> 00:18:01.780
Now, if they're not OK to be logged in

422
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.530
with uh accenture IP, then that gen light is the op option.

423
00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:08.739
And always, as I said, Gen light has to be developed for clients.

424
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.010
So it will be in the client

425
00:18:10.469 --> 00:18:15.060
cloud or client uh on prem and dedicated environment. No IP lock in

426
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.729
no asset cost from accenture because they are not

427
00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:20.540
ok with accenture assets.

428
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.689
So there will be no cost asset cost,

429
00:18:22.699 --> 00:18:26.520
medium to high cost to develop and customize because it has to be developed.

430
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.250
So cost will be little higher than the other options.

431
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.800
A relatively higher lead time to customize in

432
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.209
client environment because it has to be developed.

433
00:18:34.219 --> 00:18:38.969
So that is what the decisions that we make on, uh how to take a decisions.
