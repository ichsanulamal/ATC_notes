# DP06 - Course Completion Case Study

### Key Learnings

1. **Context Dependence in Recommendations:**
   - Lessons from different projects (P1, P2 vs. P3, P4) show that solutions effective in one context may not apply in another.

2. **Impact of Data Quality on Knowledge Generation:**
   - The quality of documentation significantly influences the accuracy of generated recommendations. For instance:
     - A spelling error in a closure note ("un Gr Ound" vs. "on ground") led to a hallucinated knowledge article.
   - Ensuring correct spelling and grammar in documentation is critical for reliable outputs from LLMs.

3. **Test Case Generation Challenges:**
   - User stories need to be clear and standard-compliant for effective test case generation.
   - Example:
     - Acronyms and abbreviations (e.g., DOJ, CS CRSD) must be clearly defined.
     - After rewriting user stories with expansions, generated test cases improved in accuracy (up to 80%).

4. **Code Generation Context:**
   - Code generation must consider dependencies across multiple files.
   - Example:
     - Changes in one code file that impact others can lead to nonsensical outputs if not all relevant files are opened.
   - Providing complete context ensures accurate code generation.

5. **Continuous Learning and Improvement:**
   - Integration of more projects into the generative AI system will yield ongoing insights.
   - A structured mechanism for harvesting learnings is essential as project scales increase.

6. **Resource Availability:**
   - While no comprehensive system exists for all learnings, efforts are underway to consolidate findings in training materials.
   - Effective learning harvesting will enhance future implementations and efficiency.

### Conclusion
These insights highlight the importance of clear documentation, context awareness, and ongoing learning in generative AI implementations to minimize errors and enhance efficiency.
