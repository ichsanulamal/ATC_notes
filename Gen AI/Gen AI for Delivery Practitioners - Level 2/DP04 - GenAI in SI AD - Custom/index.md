# DP04 - GenAI in SI/AD - Custom

## Gen AI for System Integration and Application Development

### Key Concepts

1. **Modern Engineering Archetypes**
   - Focus on **Modern Engineering** and **Migration Modernization**.
   - **Delivery Service Management** will be covered in future sessions.

2. **Objectives with Gen AI**
   - **Living Knowledge Base**: A continuously updated repository of system knowledge.
   - **Hyper Automation**: Automating processes to improve efficiency.
   - **Technical Debt Remediation**: Identifying and fixing issues quickly using the knowledge base.

3. **Modernization Approaches**
   - **Migration**: Transfer existing knowledge as-is or address existing issues.
   - **Full Modernization**: Redesign using new user stories or develop a greenfield application.

### Code Generation Process
- **Architecture Generation**:
  - Generate end-to-end architecture and design documents.
  - Produce low-level design documents, user interface styles, and code across all layers (presentation, business, data).

- **Code Remediation**:
  - Use tools like GitHub Copilot to recommend and refine code at the function and class levels.
  - Developers work on remediation after initial code generation.

### Testing and Deployment
- **Automated Testing**: 
  - Generate test cases, scripts, and test data.
  - Bind everything into a CI/CD pipeline for deployment.

### Containerization
- **Legacy Modernization**: 
  - Legacy applications can be modernized, not just containerized.
  - Automation can facilitate this process.

### Importance of Living Knowledge Base
- Essential for understanding and transitioning between architectures.
- Supports efficient migration to new frameworks (e.g., Kafka, cloud-native).
- Maintains system knowledge to reduce dependency on individual expertise.

### Ongoing Development
- Continuous updates to the knowledge base enhance adaptability for future changes.
- Any modifications post-deployment are documented and feed back into the knowledge base.

This structured approach to Gen AI in system integration and application development focuses on modern engineering practices, leveraging a living knowledge base for sustainable and efficient development.

## Use Cases for GenWizard in System Integration and Application Development

### Overview of GenWizard

GenWizard provides a comprehensive platform for various migration and transformation activities, including:
- **Database Migration**: Supporting migrations from databases like Oracle to PostgreSQL, and from other technologies to modern stacks.
- **Application Language Transformation**: Converting applications from one programming language to another (e.g., Java to Python, C++ to Java).

### Key Features

1. **Multi-Technology Support**
   - Supports various programming languages: Java, C++, Python, Visual Basic, and PL/SQL.
   - Facilitates the transformation of applications with mixed technology stacks.

2. **Living Knowledge Base**
   - Maintains a dynamic repository of application knowledge.
   - Generates topologies and documentation automatically as code is uploaded.

3. **Technical Debt Remediation**
   - Analyzes problem tickets to identify root causes.
   - Provides impact analysis, highlighting affected code, test cases, and user stories.
   - Automates code remediation and updates for impacted functions.

### Use Case Walkthrough

- **Impact Analysis for Problem Tickets**:
  - Users can enter problem tickets to analyze impacts within minutes.
  - The tool displays affected user stories, code files, and test cases.
  - Developers can view changes needed, both for existing functions (in blue) and new functions (in green).

- **Integration with Version Control Systems**:
  - The generated code can be pushed to version control (e.g., Git) for further review and testing.
  - Testers can view and adjust test cases based on impacted functionality.

### Modernization Use Cases

1. **Transitioning to New Architecture**:
   - Leverages the living knowledge base to generate new user stories and refine existing ones.
   - Supports the creation of functional architectures based on user requirements and business process hierarchies.

2. **Technical Architecture Generation**:
   - Users can customize layers of the architecture (e.g., presentation, integration, data).
   - Provides options for cloud-native architecture and infrastructure as code (IaC) generation.

3. **Customization and Flexibility**:
   - Users can define their target architecture and choose technology stacks for each layer.
   - Generates technical architecture and provisions cloud environments automatically.

### Comparison with Traditional Tools

- Unlike static analysis tools (e.g., CA Tools), GenWizard provides a living knowledge base that is contextually aware of the application, enabling more effective impact analysis and remediation.
- The integration of business process hierarchy (BPH) enhances the relevance and accuracy of generated user stories.

The capabilities of different LLMs, and the importance of accuracy in code generation and analysis.

1. **Database Migrations**: You've mentioned mapping unsupported features when migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL. This kind of mapping is essential, and it seems like you have a process in place to handle it, which is great. Custom code generation for unsupported features can be a complex task, but it sounds like you're approaching it systematically.

2. **RFP Document Summarization**: The ability to extract meaningful insights from RFP documents is a valuable feature. While it seems that full summarization isn't supported yet, being able to extract specifications could streamline the analysis process.

3. **LLM Model Integration**: Integrating different LLMs, like Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock, is indeed complex, especially when considering token limits and the need for prompt refinement. It seems you’re also aware of the potential challenges in model performance due to varying accuracies.

4. **Automation and Observability**: The "built to operate" concept that you mentioned is intriguing. Combining transformation efforts with automation and observability can significantly improve system reliability and performance during migrations.

5. **Impact Analysis and Scalability**: For your concerns about scalability and impact analysis, it seems like engaging with a POC (Proof of Concept) could provide insights. Having a repository of model capabilities would certainly be beneficial for quick reference as the landscape of LLMs continues to evolve.

If you have specific questions or areas where you’d like to dive deeper, feel free to ask!
