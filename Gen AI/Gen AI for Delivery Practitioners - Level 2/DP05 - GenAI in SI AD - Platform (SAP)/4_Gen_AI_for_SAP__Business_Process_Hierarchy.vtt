A business process hierarchy is a means to document the processes of a client.

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.630
This is done during the discover and envision phase of an SAP

2
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.220
implementation project where the client's processes

3
00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:12.899
are documented to support solution confirmation

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.180
gen wizard can complete up to six levels of the hierarchy.

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.909
When provided an input that contains fewer levels.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.829
Practically,

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.379
this represents a case when only a high level detail of a client's hierarchy is known

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.989
and detailed discussions are needed to complete the hierarchy.

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.420
The gen wizard solution can now put a customized hierarchy

10
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.470
that can be further validated and optimized during workshops.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.409
