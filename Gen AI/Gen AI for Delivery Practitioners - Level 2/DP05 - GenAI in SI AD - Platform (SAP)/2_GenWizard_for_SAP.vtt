WEBVTT

0
00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.970
We release what we call the G

1
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.039
we done for A P

2
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.149
and uh we're calling this as a workbench,

3
00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:22.510
which means that not only that you can use it

4
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.649
to obviously impress your clients and do demo of what gen

5
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.559
wizard is.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.189
But we also want our people to and then crowdsource all our people to know,

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.139
use the platform and contribute back, which is

8
00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:36.330
if you've seen Gen

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.409
Wizard demo, you

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.669
would have come across the prom marketplace.

11
00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:41.860
We want project teams to

12
00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:43.430
use the prompts,

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.659
but also recommend back and,

14
00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:48.250
and contribute back to the to the marketplace

15
00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:51.029
as well so that we are constantly bringing

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.659
the best of our delivery experiences into the platform

17
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.900
and then you use that to properly also

18
00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.259
uh deliver

19
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.340
and uh

20
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.950
access all the intelligent

21
00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.860
toss that we have.

22
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.180
So the first release that happened in December,

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.419
we started off uh with a set of 25 use cases,

24
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.879
but there's the whole plan to not come up with releases going up every quarter

25
00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.300
and you'll come that a slide coming up in a minute.

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.930
But to do that, we said

27
00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:19.169
this is an early days, right?

28
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.580
And a lot of those solutions are based on experiments that we did early on,

29
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.519
we found that there were things that

30
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.720
we learned,

31
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.959
which we thought that we would, we would not have a straight walk in there.

32
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.839
For example,

33
00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.470
when we do talk about code generation

34
00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:41.830
and I use generative A I open A I to create a code for a Python or A Java a.net.

35
00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:44.930
The efficiency is very high.

36
00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:50.029
But when I tried that on a project in North America to do code generation with

37
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.279
a A

38
00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:52.250
which is the programming language in the city,

39
00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.089
the the the efficiency levels, the accuracy scores were very low,

40
00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.389
almost like 10 20%.

41
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.139
Initially,

42
00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:00.680
then we refined the pro

43
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.309
tried to do all the plant engineering, it went up.

44
00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:05.669
But also what happened is

45
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.080
GP T 3.5 that we used in those experiments were trained till September 2021 data

46
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.639
and in the open internet sources,

47
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.690
uh all the above code that was generated was

48
00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.839
classical above or what we call as old above

49
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.330
in SAP world.

50
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.929
SAP also moved to a new modern

51
00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.220
ABA which was what we call cloud application programming and restful ABA.

52
00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.309
And on those on those uh code generation experiments,

53
00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.259
the accuracy and the fix score wellness,

54
00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.869
right?

55
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.029
So we said we need to be careful about what we promise

56
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.279
and what the product actually can do today.

57
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.110
And therefore we said four categories of the use cases were defined for helping our

58
00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:51.229
teams to understand what is the maturity of those use cases as well.

59
00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.820
And so we have private preview,

60
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.240
which is the accuracy of the experiments have been reported as low

61
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.580
public is where I think the output is OK medium, it can be better, but we can still

62
00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.509
start showing the client for the private.

63
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.800
If you want to do a demo,

64
00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.929
please have somebody from the coet work along with you so that you know

65
00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.660
what it does and what it does not uh

66
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.070
public preview, you can use it on your own as well.

67
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.210
General availability is what is saying that the output accuracy is high,

68
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.509
you can use it especially in document generation and all

69
00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.160
you can use those but savings are not

70
00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.289
confirmed because we are doing those experiments.

71
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.479
Now, since the release that we did in December,

72
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm saying we need at least six months to capture those savings and experiments.

73
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.610
And in June is when we will have these initial set of use

74
00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:41.279
cases with the savings uh part of the the solution guidelines built in,

75
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:42.119
right.

76
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.339
So,

77
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.990
so that's the details in there that you have and broadly

78
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.559
those are the categories just to remember those Harvey Balls.

79
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.990
Yeah.

80
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.130
So these are the different set of use cases across those left hand side

81
00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.490
of the picture and you'll probably see this in the demo in a minute.

82
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.399
But uh in in discover envision we've got how you can

83
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.039
use this to create your process hierarchy fit to standard.

84
00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.529
Uh You can use it to analyze your code and do similarity analysis of

85
00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:09.080
your custom objects with standard SCP objects you can use to create requirements,

86
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.889
your design deliverables FDT DS configurations

87
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.220
and all of those pretty high, I would say accuracy in there.

88
00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:22.700
And then there is a whole of aspects of A MS of work that we've done with Lion and Jung

89
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.019
and some of the clients in there.

90
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.779
Process side again, the three use cases in the bottom

91
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.470
on finance, customer service and supply chain

92
00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:35.190
and, and then talent and change and data. You've got some of them in there as well.

93
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.299
Yeah, and, and, and one other thing that we have also learned, right,

94
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:42.149
how to improve the accuracy because the content which is available

95
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.489
in in the open source is what you have in there.

96
00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:46.420
And therefore the way we said this,

97
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:51.700
we can complement open A I sources with accenture's knowledge repository.

98
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:55.339
We have great assets that we have built over the last many, many years decades.

99
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.149
Now, things like my

100
00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:56.720
concerto

101
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.260
which has all our industry accelerators process documentation, not

102
00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:01.720
so in that vector

103
00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:05.429
of accenture, look at accenture's vector database.

104
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.179
We have threatened all those 100,000 documents

105
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.380
which we have built as assets.

106
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.730
And I think the approach is that you have

107
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.579
when you, when you run these prompts,

108
00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.579
you get the best of accenture's IP and the

109
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.980
best of what is available in the open sources

110
00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:21.880
and,

111
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.940
and I think that whole IP also has to improve because uh we need

112
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.260
to keep on making sure that whatever news coming up from Mississippi is also

113
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.160
pulled back, plowed back into that uh IP base

114
00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:34.290
in terms of the NASCAR

115
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.250
of what's coming up, this is a larger list of use cases.

116
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.779
So what you see in purple are what's coming from accenture

117
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.000
SAP solutions are highlighted in blue. So a lot of things like I said, SAPJ

118
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.190
is a copilot that you would have generative A I hub as a developer platform,

119
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.510
build code is the low

120
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.920
no

121
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.799
code gene

122
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:52.820
driven uh

123
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.149
product that they have uh SAP data sphere. SAP saying you don't, you can actually

124
00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:02.160
uh no, you can actually create a vector store inside Sapsap.

125
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.160
So you your clients have that choice also to use SAPS

126
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.500
vector stores in there as well,

127
00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.519
right?

128
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.179
So, and, and, and we've been working very closely with recipe.

129
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.440
We had a call to the one recipe guys to know,

130
00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:16.609
get access to what are they talking in there?

131
00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.850
They are, they are also releasing in a very limited way.

132
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.160
But this is where I think for a customer and especially uh clients who are on recipe,

133
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.529
we will have to know uh advise them in terms of what the right options be.
