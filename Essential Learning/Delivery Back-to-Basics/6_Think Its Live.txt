Life This course will prepare your mindset for your day to day work what is think it's life every action has a consequence think before you act try recalling some corporate numbers that happened in recent years here are 2 examples 1st clients of the major local back and counted on authorized transactions in their accounts the back had to shut down the channels including A.T.M.'s which impacted millions of clients the bank has since identified the cost of human error made a programmer who had input then that transaction data on their in the wrong dates another example a local fast food giant had to close down $72.00 stores due to a new system migration they had implemented which slowed down their sales order taking product loading and transport of goods as a result they had to close down some branches because they ran out of their best selling products blunders like this could lead to financial losses to both clients and service provider distrust penalties and delayed implementations at the end of the session you will get into the think it's live mindset and inspire others to think it's Live think client business to increase everyone's awareness of the impact of their work the client's business also the increased sense of ownership or accountability to protect client's business think before you run this means the signing and building would run in mind think production this Congress protecting and keeping the production safe at all times think clients business. Think of the impact the client's business before you act understand your client's business with this knowledge you will be better equipped to serve your clients because you know their priorities your work impacts your client's business IT staff and customers a single mistake be it your code test that you run fixes to issues will not only take hours to correct but will also this Rup the lives of your team on short clients or customers that magick centrist credibility or reputation result the financial losses think about the local bank mentioned earlier what was the impact of the programmer's error to the business as you can imagine the client's business was this rep that reputation was impacted the employees were investigated and lastly customers experience panic and fear for their bank account status make it your business to understand your client's business make sure your client's business and your role in making it operate is understood by all team members treat client's business as if it's your own don't wait to be told what to do read news about your client or the industry trends so you could propose collaborate on making improvements you sound business judgment to make decisions that will best benefit your client it is important to have learning sessions with a team to understand your client's business having knowledge of clients industry priorities and strategic plan can help the team move towards helping the client the chief of their objectives do some meaningful research and learn more about their business and what is important for them think before you run design and build with Iran in mind everything you build will run in production understand the $90.00 per build the principles and make sure you design build and test with these in mind. The 1st principle is that it has to be installable there must be a recognizable installation path for the entire platform next it has to be operational the operations environment including all required system software products must have been design build and tested products must have been agreed with application management to ensure compatibility with strategic directions within operations procedures for operations task must have been designed and agreed with the application management organization next it has to be stable the system must be subject to a low failure rate and low probability of functional or technical change in the period immediately following commencement of live running any planned future releases example corrections the furred that live running must be scheduled at reasonable intervals following the introduction of the new service next it has to be supportable there must be a clear definition of how the service provided to the participants will be supported any necessary infrastructures example Dignitas this tool software distribution to remote sites configuration control must have been designed built and tested procedures for support task must have been designed and agreed with the application management next it has to be maintainable documentation and the structure of the code must be adequate to allow application management to make emergency and permanent fixes to those part of the system which are handed over to the application management organization for support with reasonable effort using an agreed staffing profile next it has to be recoverable application management must be able to recover the service from hardware or software faults with reasonable effort using an agreed staffing profile within an agreed time frame next it has to be upgradeable there must be a recognizable upgrade path for the entire platform in order to maintain relevance. Next secure and have integrity the requirements for security integrity and controls must have been defined in agreed with System stakeholders this requirements mustn't be met by design and implementation the system must be resilient to operator error as well as System Failure lastly meet service levels the system must be able to meet the service commitments with reasonable amount of system resource where contingency arrangements are required to sustain adequate service German prolonged failure scenarios adequate convention C. procedures our facilities must have been designed and tested thoroughly assess the impact your design code executable will have when it goes live it should be fit for business and fit for run ensure infrastructures has the capacity to handle measure and calculate performance of your code functionality means nothing if the performance sucks implement secure coding practices to protect clients system from security threats and risks think before you run test everything actively secure Q.A. sign off there is no excuse not to test if 100 percent testing is not possible or not practical perform risk based testing or utilize automation whenever possible the automation that will be implemented should be able to cover more tests in Ariosto and help eliminate human error codes procedures S.Q.L. scripts executables need to be tested consider negative and regression testing if there are changes in requirements always assess their impact to the overall functionality of the application implement version control and test from scratch ensure that the code and testing meet the standards before their deployment to production. Conduct peer review and all deliverables that will go into production get formal sign offs approvals on major New York to video or deliverables critical and highly visible changes for the auction remember that time to break something is during testing not in production think before you run collaborate all teams have a role to play in deployment there are several parties or stakeholders in all our contracts when you build Keep in mind that your product will support the customer and the customers customer as a designer developer or tester your deliverables will go into the production it is essential that you work with the operations team from the start as a part of the operations team be aware of the release plants and be actively involved in any new development or integration projects going into production if you have any doubts about the release Do not let it into production think before you run expect the best but plan for the worst remember the most successful team is a team that executes Plan B. the best no plan ever survives 1st contact with the enemy plan and test roll back and back out procedures when deploying something a lot time for rollback and back out of the string migration in the ID industry there have been many deployments or fixes that did not end well because there is no proper back out time one example a client rolled out a hotfix for a critical portion of the operating system and the hotfix ended up revealing a corruption in their image that lead dormant for years unnoticed the client took an extended period to react to the issue because testing did not show any issues in the lab only in production Ideally they would have reacted more quickly and acted the backup plan but alas they did not have one then count the unnecessary grief because someone did not create and test proper recovery plan the concept of a backup plan is very simple. Reverse the chain just introduce as quickly as possible with the least amount of impact possible what are the elements of a good backup plan change request manager to be contacted upon a failed change a step by step guide to returning the environment back to working state the backup plan should be documented a Spart of any change request the contact details of all parties involved necessary to get environment back up and running a communications plan to keep all involved in the progress of the change and time to recover should the panic button be hit a proper communication plan needs to be acted upon also to keep all stakeholders a price of the issue think production keep production safe and secure but hear through our policies no and follow your clients and Accenture security requirements and policies strictly follow your documented production procedures at all times don't skip or change the sequence of steps have a printed copy of the document the procedures for quick reference set up visual cues in your work area to enforce vigilance when you're working in production think production production is sacred handle it with care in some geographies security breaches can be personal liabilities protect your clients and protect yourself access systems and data on a need to basis and within a limited time only exit out of production a soon as you're done. Think production be proactive spot and prevent issues before they happen monitor monitor and monitor yet also know what or why you monitor and when you need to take action actively race and investigate problem tickets before a critical incident happens inform your lead or manager as soon as you see risk or an issue ask for help don't delay report security and data breaches to your supervisor security guards or call the Accenture Security Operations Center remember that we are not only protecting our client system we are also protecting eccentrics reputation and relationships we are also preventing long hours of on this work for the whole team be proactive and diligent about prevention an ounce of prevention far outweighs a pound of cure before we end here's a recap of the think it's life mindset that we should apply to our day to day work think client business think of the impact the client's business before you act make it your business to understand your client's business think before you run this sign and build would run in mind test everything actively seek your Q.A. sign offs collaborate all teams have a role to play in deployment expect the best but plan for the worst think production keep production safe and secure adhere to our policies production is sacred handle it with care be proactive spot and prevent issues before they happen thank you.
