What should your status report contain at the minimum your status report should have the 4 components start a summary this is where you will state the overall status of your scope of work in the scenario of Vic's that a summary can be likened to notifications in your phone such as badges banners and alerts it can also be a simple as the battery icon signal level or 3 G. L.T.E. indicator next is the use of delivery metrics it is important to back the report up with hard numbers to prove the statements you're making if you look at your phone you will also be able to identify measure says such as the battery percent left phone memory data usage or your load issues and risks it is crucial to identify the issues and risk we have on our projects so as we're able to take actions to mitigate them imagine when you were prompted in your phone of the low battery we were able to identify the issues and risks such as the low battery and the impact which is your phone dying and we are able to take action in resolving this which is charging or enabling your energy saving mode lastly key milestones and deliverables milestones are often tied to the completion of a set of deliverables your phone apps also give you milestones examples are fitness apps that motivate you by letting you know the mouse and once you have been able to accomplish again at the minimum your status report should have this 4 components your status summary your delivery metrics issues and risks key milestones and deliverables in creating an effective status report these are general hints and tips you can follow use the foresees know your audience know your key messages use your metrics make the time to do a good job and last ask for help we will be discussing each of this areas in detail. 1st use the force cease a good status report is concise yet comprehensive clear correct and coherent some common mistakes in doing a status report are key messages being unclear rag status metrics and narratives are not consistent in appropriate detail too much or too little status reporting should be easily understood by external stakeholders on the project do not use acronyms or any project specific terminology and abbreviations keep your statement directed a point concise yet accurate and meaningful use objective statements with numbers or data to provide more context give an idea where projects health is heading and specify roles instead of names to make it easier to understand for people outside the project 2nd Know your audience a common mistake is having a status report written for people who are very familiar with the project who will read your report is it somebody within the project or somebody outside of your project if somebody outside of your account the status must include sufficient context and be written such that someone without prior knowledge of the delivery is able to identify the key issues pertaining to the resulting rag status of the project when reviewing your report review from the perspective of the recipient will they understand specific terms used by your project or will it be more appropriate if you will use more common terms if you know that your report will reach Accenture leadership or the client use language or terms that are more appropriate for sharing across wider audiences so know your key messages a common mistake a syrup or what's been done during the week instead of the this against the plan.
