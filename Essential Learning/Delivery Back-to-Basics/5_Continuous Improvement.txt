Delivery back to basics continuous improvement this back to basics course will highlight the key things you need to know in regards to continuous improvement at the end of this course you will learn what is continuous been proven and how it plays in the delivery process why is it important what are the challenges of implementing it and how to get into the mindset of continuous improvement here are actual scenarios from the public string These are excerpts on how individuals have implemented continues improvements in their daily engagements the 1st one focuses on doing continuous improvement by eliminating defects through efficient task assignments Francis on the other hand also implemented continuous improvement that brought about 0 percent cost of rework through innovation and use of standard templates the next is gesture that he implemented individual continue some proven which resulted in 79 percent defect rate improvement through proper coaching he leverage automation and pyramid optimization to improve client satisfaction the project also utilized the performance analytics tool that drastically improved the average resolution effort from 6 hours to $2.00 hours a 54 percent improvement in the ticket resolution was achieve using this analytics tool what is continuous improvement anyway it is a method for identifying opportunities for streamlining work and reducing waste the practice is being used by many companies and seeking improvement on a different stage of development or scope of work in a nutshell continuous improvement is simply to do better how do you go about continuous improvement in a structured point of view. 1st we identify the opportunities in the process what are the areas we can improve on 2nd plan how we can improve those situations once we have those in place we can now do execution where we will implement those changes after which we review and compare to gauge effectiveness of the improvement actions and determine whether the implemented action addressed the problem we are trying to solve Lastly we do not just to sit on those improvement actions but we share it so others can also benefit from it why do we need to do continuous improvement for our client we need to do continuous improvement through these time to market increase productivity improve quality minimize and avoid defects reduce costs and secure their systems for Accenture we need to be at par or ahead of our competitors to avoid risks in losing contracts and clients also as a business we want to increase our profitability as individuals we may not notice this but as employees of Accenture we perform continuous improvement and this improves our own skills lessens time and effort needed from us to complete a task Lastly doing continuous improvement is good for us in essence why do we need to do continuous improvement if you're familiar with Nokia in the past they were the leading mobile telecommunications company they chose to remain on the status quo they did not innovate on their O.O.S. and the phones they manufactured this resulted in their competitor Apple overtaking them and becoming the new standard for mobile communications This left in the key out of the market another good example would be Intel. Intel is currently having a hard time marketing their chips as most devices now are mobile and there is a decrease in P.C. sold in the market Intel could be in the verge of being similar with Nokia this Kipps keeps intel on their toes and they must keep innovating to keep up with the times from a business context why do we need to do continuous improvement if the answer is because the client expects us to do so clients expect us to deliver on time on a much faster rate in terms of quality it should be right in terms of cost it needs to be cheap and in terms of service it needs to be easy ideas and continuous improvement should add value if it does not it does not serve its purpose value usually means savings or any service that is improved that puts the clients above in performance what are the triggers in doing continuous improvement when something goes wrong these are just some of the approaching these who can do continuous improvement actions we do it when we have a defects review findings from different types of reviews missed S. a lace when productivity is decreasing increase in backlog and costs or clients are not satisfied with their work in addition it is very important to still do continuous improvement even though there are no issues but we still want to improve our current state of the delivery and quality we should not settle for anything less what are the challenges in doing continuous improvement one there's no contest improvement program for to some primitive of these are not included in the work plan and budget contests improvement activities are not logged we're unaware of contests improvement processes or what the target. There is a lack of push or support from leads or X X there's a compressed timeline no tool to monitor continuous improvement progress it's complicated implementation involved there's no budget to invest in tools when we tried to reason out or develop those problems instead of doing it this improvement and then our performance stagnates we had here to the status quo and become obsolete continuous prove MINACK Tiffany's our D. prioritize and deferred at some point this results in over budget unknown and forgotten areas for continuous improvement and there will be a lack of direction or confusion and lastly overdue action items what we need to do to address this of course we try to promote trainings inject contests improvement discussions and team meetings post-mortems R.C.A.'s log disapprove meant using a centralized repository automate processes provide realize values and proposals to projects and most importantly we should have a continuous improvement mindset here are some key takeaways number one have a continuous improvement mindset take every opportunity as an opportunity to improve to help is just around the corner utilize available tools methods and support channels the delivery performance team consolidates all continuous improvement actions and places all of these in a centralized repository that can be accessed by all projects and return all projects are encouraged to share best practices within the organization by submitting these actions to the delivery performance team lastly. Remember that continuous improvement is everybody's responsibility before we end the session let me give you some questions and try to thinking about them and answer them on your own question number one what is the possible benefit of implementing continuous improvement activities a less defects better quality be cust reduction less effort spent see faster time to complete work or streamlined tasks be dissatisfied clients or letter A B. and C. If you answered E You got it right question number 2 true or false projects don't need to track continuous improvement actions via log sites if they are already discussing going to supreme and activities during team meetings true or false this is false question number 3 what is our possible triggers to perform contents improvement a there's a high defect count be productivity metrics are met for the past 12 months see peer review or S.W. P. a recurring findings D. all of the above or EAT A and C. Only if you answer D. You got it right question number 4 What is are the available initiatives used to help us in our continuous improvement activities a Oprah B H B A N C Q C I D all of the above eat B. and C. Only if you had to you got it right. Question number 5 what is our possible venues to discuss continuous improvement activities a brainstorming or team meetings B R C A C post-mortem meetings D all of the above or A N C Only if you answered D. That is correct this training think you.
