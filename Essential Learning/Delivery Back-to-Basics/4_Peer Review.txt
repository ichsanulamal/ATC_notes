Delivery back to basics peer review the objectives of this course is to give the audience basic understanding about peer review and how it is implemented throughout the different delivery stages in this course we will talk about the importance of peer review the different peer review techniques common mode practices and challenges in implementing peer review and how implementing an effective peer review process can help achieve successful delivery Let us begin with this real life story there was an A.O. project that supports an essay P.C.'s them in December 2015 the client had an escalation due to issues encountered in production some of this issues include incidents that cost the clients demand forecast planning data for all 20 E.M.E.A. sales organizations countries to be wiped out incidence issues that resulted in incorrect billing which costs $1800000.00 euros additional revenue to be reversed another incident is on missing factory production planning data the cost delay in V.W. business reports for $11.00 hours so what do you think is the cost for these issues the A.T.O. project team did the root cause analysis and it was found out that the reasons were G D 4 items no proper documentation of critical processes lack of peer review journal weekends inefficient escalation and communication process as well as a lack of deep understanding on the solutions impact what the STIS tell us. Basically the key learning of this projects were 1st they must make sure they have documentation for any critical process ensure the documents are updated and available for access of the project team members at all times in the project's case they use a share point for uploading all relevant reference however the process documents they sions contained outdated information 2nd there should be strict implementation of peer review based on the results of root cause analysis the project did not do peer review on weekends because of this they missed capturing the facts that should have been contained and addressed prior to deployment this defects cost issues encountered by the client 3rd when in doubt there is nothing wrong in asking for help lastly do not move certain changes in production without securing proper approval or sign offs the story tells us about the importance of not just peer review but other quality processes that should be followed to ensure a successful delivery and avoid production issues in this course we will discuss this more when we do peer review what is peer review a peer review is that they can eat use to verify the accuracy and compliance of the work product against requirements early in the development life cycle as the term implies it means a developer Swart or deliverable must undergo review of another developer or peer so that there is another set of eyes validating correctness and completeness of the deliverable. Regardless of what software development life cycle one developer is using whether waterfall or agile peer review must be part of the work plan and reviewers must be assigned to make sure it will be part of the development process there are 4 different types of peer reviews 1st is inspection it is also known as an facilitated peer review in this type the owner of the work product proactively verifies it that hears to the project standards the owner of the deliverable coordinates or works directly with the reviewers to understand whether there are comments review points or defects that need to be addressed before receiving this final off now we move to the 2nd one on the facilitated peer review this type is also known as Chuck structured walk through the review takes place in the meeting we're in the product owner or the author meets with the reviewers and gives them a walkthrough of the requirements and equivalent equivalent work product the reviewer can ask questions or provide comments identify whether there are potential defects noncompliance or other impacts that must be addressed so that there will be no defects when the product is delivered like inspection it is ideal that all actions items are addressed at the end of the facilitated peer review meaning so that there is timely signed off or approval of the work product the 3rd type is death check this is one review and debugging technique by the owner or an individual who is not directly involved in the application development process this is usually ideal or effective when one used with a checklist the last one is a round robin which is an enhanced version of best check and performed by multiple reviewers in a sequential manner. You have done something similar or any of this for types of peer review in your project you probably just don't know what is called regardless of what S D L C or lifecycle you're doing peer review is in a bull with different styles and techniques as mentioned earlier we would like to highlight that if you do any of the 4 you use or complement that with a review checklist tool which should be tailored to your specific project deliverables requirements and standard that after the review process you can produce a product that is of high quality to continue now we talk about the quality activity pyramid when we work we should make sure that each deliverable we create must undergo a series of quality Tiffany's this pyramid indicates that there are 3 steps that a deliverable must undergo to ensure quality or that it is defect proof we start with self check this is the 1st step for a person or a deliverable owner to ensure that the work product complies with the current Tyria or the project standard to make sure that the deliverable is correct any developer must do proactive checking of the quality of any work product that he or she will complete It's like reviewing your answers before submitting your exam paper to your teacher after self check is done it would be submitted to a reviewer for peer review Jaring peer review the assigned review or checks the deliverable or work product and logs points comments or defects in peer review sheets during this process the owner must address all the review points in the log sheet all Review points should be addressed before the review or provide sign off. It is a cycle ask the deliverable owner reviews and reworks he must do a self check again to make sure the points race are no longer valid and that it has already been addressed prior to submitting for another round of peer review the last one is test. Which is another form of quality check several levels of testing can be performed during that development unit or component Test Product system test or user acceptance test the pyramid tells us that the big chunk of the quality review must happen during the self check you don't need to wait until the test or the last activity for you to know that your deliverable is not of good quality we must safeguard whatever we produce to make sure there are no surprises in the end by following the 3 tier pyramid we are limiting production defects or client escalations in addition preventing defects during the early stages of development will also save the project from costs in fixing defects note that fixing defects found in for duction or in the latter faces of development will result in higher costs rather than fixing defects found at early stages of development why do peer review here's another story imagine you are in your project and you have completed the plan analyze stage then you move to design to build then code and product test when the work product did not undergo peer review in any or all of the stages what do you think will happen if no peer review was conducted the product will fail during testing which means additional unplanned effort because of rework. This will result in additional costs and probably delay in delivering the end product the delivery team will have to go back to the early stages to redo a lot of the change to the code and give it back to the testing team very important lesson here is we should contain our defects in the early stage possible why it is cheaper that way and we would like to refrain rework us to be near the end of the development life cycle if we do the review jury deploy or test age it would be too late already if we realize that there are critical defects by that time this is a study conducted at the P.T.C. level it was found out that 67 percent of the livery process review findings are related to gaps in the implementation of processes specifically peer review what the stat mean this means that in some projects peer review process is not established or executed or there are gaps in the implementation let us review the common malpractises and the corresponding risks and issues 1st peer review is not defined it is very important that peer review process will be set up during the start of peer review process is one of the foundation deliverables that should be in place before a project starts its delivery work if there is no defined process there is no way a project team member can effectively execute peer review 2nd review activities are not included in the estimates hence no equivalent task in the work plan. It is the manager or delivery leads responsibility to ensure budget is allocated for review in addition joining the solution face the architects must factor in budget for view as it is very important if there is no budget allocated for peer review execution of this quality will not be planned and tracked this will result in poor delivery and over budget just the high cost of rework 3rd point sheets are not populated point sheets where the reviewer documents all the findings in in the point there are identifiers on the defect type the stage where the defect was found along with other important details having a template that is consistently used for documenting period view findings will help the project lead easily identify areas for improvement for example if majority of the findings are related to not following coding standards actions such as educating the developer or using automated code review tools can help prevent similar defects in the future sending of review points verbal E.R.V.'s email is discourage if there is no standard way of tracking defects consolidation of information for analysis will be challenging forth review points are not being analyzed even if the project performs consistently recording of findings but the reports just sit somewhere and no analysis is being made the a porch need to improve is wasted a project should analyze spirit view that are and implement actions to prevent similar defects for the current or future releases 50 no review checklist or tool is being used. A good tool will guide the reviewer This will also ensure that all areas are covered jury the review revisit the check items know a regular basis to ensure that the checklist is still relevant or up to date the project should ensure there is a tailored guide that is best suited for the current release or requirement in deception we will talk about the key areas of the review checklist in each of the face there are areas that need to be validated we will briefly discuss each area Analyze This is where your S.D.L.C. starts the checklist must contain points to help the owner in review or confirm the requirements are clear in the design the checklist must help to make sure designs are traceable to the requirement there should also be a check on the interface in the build the checklist should contain items on efficiency standards Data Definition logic common errors functionality flow diagram as well as configuration management this are the areas that should be looked into at the build face journeying testing period view looks at the completeness and soundness of the test plan and test cases actual test results should also be properly documented for the deploy face key deliverables to check our the deployment plant's configuration workbook migration documents and review and go live readiness to lesson efforts in doing review there are code quality tools and test automation tools that can help ensure the liberals are following the defined standards ask your supervisor on the different sets of tools being used in your project what's in peer review for you. There is a project that supports a telecom client the team uses a P L S.Q.L. scripts or queries for order extraction and data pull for analysis and resolution on a daily basis to ensure the newly created scripts will not cost utilization issues in the system when executed in production all queries are reviewed the key challenge in the review process is that it is time consuming and labor intensive because there are no sufficient guidelines established the team implemented a S.Q.L. code review checklist which helped them reduce the effort by 69.6 percent on the 1st year having said this peer review is not just for defect tracking but to know areas for improvement for sustainable delivery you do not just track it and put it on your point sheet but basically it allows you to identify areas to contain this The improve on in this project they could give the client savings which made the client happy and at the same time they could make use of the tools and checklists which helped them achieve 0 incidents summarizing the contents of this training the key takeaways are the following perform Piri of you to any work product that is part of a client deliverable utilize review checklist in available tools analyze results for identifying continuous improvement opportunities defect containment at an early stage is cheaper than doing real work on succeeding phases before we end this session let's do some exercises for the exercise we have 5 questions that we'd like you to think about Question number one where do you document the peer review process. A Quality Management Plan B. scope Management Plan C. project plan D. I don't know or maybe e none of the above let me give you a couple of seconds to think about it if you answered A Yes you are correct it would be quality management plan question number 2 after all the reviews review points are. Collected to be analyzed for potential continuous improvement be logged into potential sheets for tracking see reported a Spart of metrics D. both A and B. or even a B. and C. If you answered. You got the right answer question number 3 in a project with less than 5 resources peer review should be done to. All requirements be complex requirements only see meet him requirements only D. randomly in all requirements or maybe e B. and C. If you chose a you got the right answer question number 4 what peer review technique can be used to design documents a facilitated review be desk C inspection D A and C. or each B. and C. If you answer D. that will be the correct answer A and C. facilitator of you as well as inspection question number 5 you receive the design from client team just a day before your target time to complete the code what is or what are your next steps. A proceed to coding and submit your work for review be verified the design document is complete ask for your exit criteria before starting the code see log a risk that you might deliver the code late because you received the design document D.D. C. then D. and then a or E.G. which would be the 1st C. and then. The answer would actually be letter B. the 1st logger risk then verify the design and lastly proceed to coding reference materials related to peer review are available in Accenture delivery methods and that are up are top topic for a period view we hope you learn from this course and you will implement this lessons in your projects Thank you.
