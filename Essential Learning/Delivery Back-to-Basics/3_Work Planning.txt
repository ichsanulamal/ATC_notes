Delivery back to basics work planning this back to basics course will highlight the key things you need to know about work planning as a project manager team leader or team member you would think of the following questions How much effort is allotted to finish this task and when should I finish them who is working and what particular requirement at a particular stage of your project when do we start to finish the work that we need to do who will review the work that I am doing what are the task assigned to me this week and the week to come are we on track for next week's invitation you would like to know if there are delays in the work that your team is currently doing is the estimate enough to complete the work the answers to this questions can be found in a work plan in this diagram you will notice that the questions posted earlier actually revolves around what the school budget staffing and scheduling are you will see that the core of this is a work plan what exactly is a work plan work planning is a fundamental process used to plan track and forecasts the work to be delivered by each individual and projects using a standard project management tool work planning cycle the picture you see is an actual work plan most projects use Microsoft Project as their work planning tool What are the components of a good work plan a good work plan normally has tasks budget and duration Tasks are the decent you need to complete within a given period example for a developer a task can be coding of a particular component for a team lead a task in the reviewing deliverables budget is how much you are given in terms of efforts hours to complete a particular task for instance a developer is given 40 hours to complete the technical design the budget should be reflected in the work plan the developer is then expected to complete the task exceeding 40 hours of effort. Duration is the total number of the days it will take for one task to be completed know the budget and duration are not the same budget is the total effort a person needs to complete one task duration is the number of days it will take a person to complete the task for example a developer is working 2 hours per day in one task if he is given 10 hours budget then it will take 5 days for him to finish the task 5 days is the duration it doesn't always follow that the developer will take up to 9 hours per day for a task assigned once a task budget and duration are known the developers can already start working on his components for the entire work planning cycle to be effective resources are expected to be given up to updates on their actual progress and or estimated time to complete the actual is the number of hours a person has already spent working on a task progress will answer the question How much have you accomplished so far for instance a person S. is assigned to create a particular component normally the supervisor will ask the assigned person to indicate the person 3rd of task completion example 10 percent 25 E.T.C. or the estimated time to complete is not budget less the actual Rather it is the estimate from team members and how much time they still need to complete the assigned task E.T.C. is from the perspective the person is actually working on the task sometimes when the actual is a bit over or under budget the lead relies on team members pursue provide the E.T.C. severe task this is so there is an accurate measure in terms of understanding where the task is common practice the following are the common practice in work planning. A large percentage 29 percent of the finding says that Excel based tools for use in tracking project activities use of Excel as a work planning tool is discourage 22 percent was due to incomplete work breakdown structures 15 percent was due to actual IS NOT be charged properly 12 percent said that there is no work plan or time tracking tool use that all 6 percent indicated that there was no rebase lining process 16 percent was attribute that to other common law practices these findings will be discussed in the succeeding signs common more practices no work plan or time tracking tool no work plan and use of deliverable or requirement list with end dates and status what would be the risk and issues associated with this malpractise for the 1st bullet point a project with no work plan has no visibility of all the work to be done and it's progress this is already an issue the premise here is that the project should use a work plan and utilize Emmis project in tracking to Vittie tasks and how much is actually spent so that the progress of all of Tiffany's can be easily determined M.-S. project has built in functionality which can easily be used to know where the status this in terms of metrics schedule variance are cost variance can be generated as a developer having visibility of the work plan provides a view of succeeding task to be handled hence giving the project team members a sense of direction. 2nd bullet point notes projects cannot forecast work completion overtime idle time and manage resource utilization if you have a work plan you will have an overall view of your project from the end then you'll be able to know for example if a task is delayed and how it will impact the succeeding activities it will also help the needs decide if working overtime is necessary 3rd bullet proper assignment of work cannot be done if there is no work plan people will not know what task they need to work on there will be no references for this supervisors project managers and team leads to do follow ups lastly without work plan you will not be able to determine or see the impact of a delay of one task will do to your project the other more practice is in this like no time tracking tool or not tracking actual hours if the project is NOT have any tool to track actually it would be difficult to track the project burn and amount of remaining budget resulting in high risk of going over budget it will be hard to determine if the remaining budget the sufficient to complete the face there is still a the developers are spending higher than the budget if there is no data to be used for analysis if estimates were enough or not it will be difficult for the project lead to identify problem areas or areas they can improve on historical data is vital as those are being used for planning exceeding releases in addition there will be no source of data for metric reporting common malpractise work breakdown structure incomplete the next set of malpractises are incomplete work breakdown structure no review task bucket no rework task bucket of complete work breakdown structure B.S. Should the minimum consist of a task and under it are there review and rework buckets. If there are no tasks I look at it for review and rework the following issues might happen tasks at high risk of not being done if not included in the work plan examples peer reviews the project is also running the risk of not having capacity to support the activity or tasks when creating a work plan the more detailed it is the better because leads will be able to have a deeper understanding of the progress of activities for example if there was a deadly and the tasks are not sufficiently broken down it will be challenging to determine where the delay is coming from especially for large projects for instance there is a development project which spans a year and build will take 3 months if all the 20 developers charged only one task for 3 months and there is no breakdown of the subtasks there will be a lack of information when there is insufficient information it cannot be used for analysis and identification of corrective or preventive actions the last issue or risk related to these common practices is performance analysis and improvement planning will be difficult as the necessary measures will be incomplete example cost of rework review effectiveness etc while a particular release is in progress or when a release gets completed developers are tasked to provide metrics like COST OF rework or review effectiveness this is because this metrics are important for planning for succeeding releases for instance planning for what needs to be done to prevent the same risks and issues for future releases. Common the practices project is using Excel for work plan and time tracking the issues or risk for this malpractise is that there is a risk of data loss or data corruption all tasks are fuel bill to other resources hence can be accidentally edited by other resources M S X L The bigger the volume of data the longer it takes for it to open Also there is a high risk of the data file getting corrupted or recommended work planning tool is M S Project Common law practices actually not charge properly rework of charge at past creation actually not charge on time what are the repercussions of this 3 progress reporting will be inaccurate which might result in accurate decisions actual Sorby use of a project manager team leads to make decisions such as if there is a need to ask people to work extra hours if the project is ready delayed another scenario is when the rework is touch a task creation some individuals just charge the time spent just the review points to the task creation bucket since the B.B.S. does not have the reworks of buckets to charge to risk on the lease and delivery cannot be recognised properly if actual is are not charged time then it will be hard to determine if there are delays overspending metrics data will be misleading similar to the 1st point when there is incorrect data it could lead to incorrect decisions for the project correct or 6 of a good work plan a good work plan should be able to provide a clear picture of projects work this is inclusive What's go you have budget timeline and resources provides a means on how goals will be achieved efficient way of tracking actual hours provides a view of current projects work progress. The work plan should be able to give the team members a snapshot of where they are this can be used to determine if the project is delayed ahead of schedule over budget under budget a good work plan enables you to understand if you need additional resources or if you need to do overtime allows identification of risks that need action if the right information is available in the workplace the project will be able to do inform decisions it will also be easier for you as a developer to identify risks capture actuals for future improvement on the estimates this practice will be very helpful for a long running projects of multiple releases it will be definitely helpful in terms of improving the estimation what if what if you have a work plan and you already have your task budget duration and the whole cycle is working effectively and then comes an additional task and scope in some instances client or client teams will ask the developer to add a new work like an object or requirement which was not initially part of the scope when you encounter this scenario make sure to inform your leads such as school changes and additional tasks should not be done without prior assessment and approval from a change control board any additional task scope which needs to be added to the current work needs to undergo proper excess meant change control process and approval once this steps have been done that's the only time can make changes to the work plan triggers 3 baseline let's not talk about rebase lining you need to re baseline your work plan when there is an approved change in scope approval should come from the Change Control Board change in budget schedule which may be due to but not limited to increase in complexity delay and requirement or dependency incorrect initial estimates most importantly there should be no rebase lining without approval. Here are some key takeaways a work plan provides a view of the project scope budget schedule and staffing work plan should provide your T.B.D. pass budget and duration and you should also give your A.P. actual progress and. A good plan does not guarantee a perfect picture but a work without a plan is a factor for failure and sure all work being done is part of the approved the plan if not in the plan get approval we have a few questions to test what you have learned.
