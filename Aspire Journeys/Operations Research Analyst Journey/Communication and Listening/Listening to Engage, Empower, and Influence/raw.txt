I'm here with you today because I firmly believe that effective listening is key to success at work, at home, and in life. This course will expose you to practical skills for drawing out and synthesizing others’ viewpoints; in service of improving your individual performance; bringing out the best in others; and creating the best possible solutions to the challenges faced by today's organizations.

2. Video: Active Listening to Improve Engagement (bs_acm35_a02_enus_02)

We communicate in person using three channels: our words, our tone of voice, and our body language. Research suggests that our tone of voice and body language convey 93% of our meaning. As listeners, it’s critical to pay attention to not only what’s being said, but how it’ being said. In this video, you'll learn key skills to improve your active listening.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Active Listening to Improve Engagement. [Video description ends]
HOST: Everybody tosses around the phrase active listening, but not everybody can tell you what it actually means. Try this, from the International Coaching Federation: “the ability to focus completely on what the speaker is saying and is not saying to understand the meaning in the context of the speaker’s desires, opinions and self-expression.” Note the emphasis on paying attention to what's not being said. It’s important. We communicate in person using three channels: our words, our tone of voice, and our body language.

Research suggests that our tone of voice and body language convey 93% of our meaning. Only 7% is conveyed by our words. As listeners, it's critical to pay attention to not only what's being said, but how it’s being said. Are the speaker’s arms crossed? Are they making eye contact? What about facial expressions?

Do you feel like a dentist trying to extract information like a fractured tooth, or is there free free-flowing conversation? This points out the importance of recognizing key active listening skills, and how they address both the spoken and the unspoken. The first of these skills is asking questions. Listening begins with a simple act of asking a question. Simple, yes, but not easy. Author Jean Marie Digiovanna writes, “Questions are the fuel that sparks open dialog and inspires new ways of thinking.” And the most impactful questions are open-ended, prompting more than a “yes or no” answer.

Open-ended questions invite speakers to expound and expand on their ideas. A second skill is using verbal and nonverbal prompts. A verbal prompt is a simple expression that signals to the speaker that you are listening and invites additional contribution. These are things like, “uh huh,” “tell me more,” and “what else?” Nonverbal communication can speak even louder than words. It indicates to the speaker if we're paying attention to what they're saying. Consider the power of making eye contact and giving a simple head nod to encourage a speaker to continue.

Another skill involved in active listening is called "naming it." This refers to your ability to articulate what you're sensing from the listener, beyond their words, getting to their underlying message and meaning. But remember, this isn’t without risk, and you may, in fact, be off base. Consider the possibility of saying something like, “I may be off here, but you seem a little distant. What’s happening on your end?” That may or may not be the case for the speaker.

However, you, the listener, have sensed something going on with them, even if they can’t relate to the word “distant,” it at least opens the door for them to express what they’re feeling. A further active listening skill is to summarize and check-in. This means periodically summarizing what a speaker has said so far. It's a powerful technique that both lets the speaker know that you're listening and ensures that you've accurately understood what they said. “What I’m hearing you say is... Am I correct?” This gives the speaker the opportunity to clarify, if necessary.

A closely related active listening skill is a type of summarizing known as echo or repeat. The speaker speaks. The listener takes the last couple of words and repeats them, either in a statement or as a question. For example, if the speaker says “the customer is really angry” and you respond “angry?,” you give the speaker the chance to open up and expand on the situation. And a final skill is allowing for silence.

It's been said that we all have two ears and one mouth and should use them in that proportion. Our silence can allow others the space to collect their thoughts and articulate them. Of course, silence can become awkward, and some are uncomfortable with it. There’s always the temptation to fill it. Don’t. Eventually, the person with whom you are conversing will break it. But if the silence has become deafening, it’s time to practice your “name it” skills. Check in and see what the other person’s thinking.

PAUL SHERMAN: I was recently facilitating a meeting among a customer service team at a financial services company. And what had happened was there were an increase in complaints coming into the call center and they were talking about how do we solve that issue? Well, the conversation was really lively. And I noticed that there was one person, Brian, sitting there really quietly. So I called timeout in the conversation and I checked in with Brian and I said, "What’s going on over there, Brian?" And there was a long silence. Now you'll notice I didn't ask Brian for his content contribution.

I really wanted to check in with him on his state of mind. There's this very long silence. And by the way, silences, while they feel awkward, are very important part of listening. After a long silence, Brian chimed in. "I’m super frustrated," he said. "The ideas are flying around so quickly that I have no time to process them. And by the time I do process them, you've all moved on to the next topic. It’s very frustrating. There’s no time or space for me to chime in. And also, I'm being quiet, and nobody's even asking me my opinion."

Well, Brian was dealing with a situation that's very common that gets in the way of good listening, which is that people have different styles of interacting. In this case, Brian's an introvert and introverts process information more in their minds as opposed to speaking out and processing their information real-time. So this also gets exacerbated in group settings that people's styles need to be honored even more when you're in a group setting. I acknowledged Brian for his courage in speaking up. And we moved forward, the team adapted to his style, he adapted a little bit more to their style, and the meeting went on in a productive and positive way.

HOST: Think about the best radio, TV, or podcast interviewers.

What do they do?

How do they come across?

How do they put their subjects at ease?

Now think of your own listening skills in comparison.

Where do you excel?

Where could you use some growth?

3. Video: Listening for Connection and Authenticity (bs_acm35_a02_enus_03)

The relationship between the speaker and the listener is the foundation of good listening. Does the speaker feel comfortable? Do they feel like the listener has a genuine interest and appreciate what’s being said, or is the listener just going through the motions? In this video, you'll learn about ways to show your genuine interest in what the speaker has to say.

HOST: The relationship between the speaker and the listener is the foundation of good listening.

Does the speaker trust and feel comfortable with the listener?

Does the speaker feel like the listener has a genuine interest and appreciate what's being said, or is the listener just going through the motions?

PAUL SHERMAN: Janelle’s the manager of an accounting team at a global telecommunications company. She and her team had just gone through a workshop on active listening, and she and I were debriefing it.

Paul, she said to me, "We learned some really good techniques -" things like reflecting words - what I’m hearing you say is. We also learned about reflecting emotions. For example, huh, you seem pretty frustrated about that. These are great techniques. But there’s a problem. We’ve become a bunch of robots. We’re just parroting these techniques. Nobody is truly internalizing what they're hearing.

And listening has become hollow. As a result, folks just aren’t chiming in and participating anymore. And active listening has been labeled "phony listening." What I suggested to Janelle is that she sit down with the team and have a conversation about authenticity in listening. And that's exactly what she did. And what the team did was talking about what does authenticity and listening really mean? Well, authenticity really is nothing more than just being your genuine self. And in listening authentically, how do you put yourself in the shoes of somebody else?

How do you experience their experience? How do you become actually compassionate about what the other person is speaking? Well, the team agreed. "We’re going to become authentic listeners in using the active listening techniques." And guess what happened? Listening improved and the team became even more productive and positive. HOST: Author and philosopher, Henry David Thoreau once said, “the greatest compliment that was ever paid me was when someone asked me what I thought and attended to my answer.”

Key here are the verbs “ask” and “attend.” We know the power of questions. They’re how we ask. Now it's time to address the attending part and look at some important ways we can demonstrate our genuine interest in what others have to say. As listeners trying to demonstrate interest, we must look at the motives, mindset, and mental attitude behind our listening. There is scientific evidence that proves that people know when we’re faking it.

People can sense an inauthentic listener a mile away. And research supports it. False listening - when someone is pretending to be paying attention but isn’t - can be subtle, but it has its telltale signs. These are things like excessive fidgeting, fixed or glazed eyes, and a lack of responsive body language, to name the most obvious. Further, the human brain contains a set of specialized cells called mirror neurons. Through our mirror neurons, we can understand the underlying intent of what someone is saying.

In other words, in a way, we are mind readers. If someone isn't being genuine in their listening, the speaker can sense it and is less likely to fully express themselves in the conversation. And in a way, mirror neurons are contagious. They can set the emotional tone of a conversation. If the listener is respectful, positive and optimistic, the speaker will tend to mirror that. However, it's critical that you first meet the speaker where they are.

In other words, if the speaker isn't in a positive state of mind, before you can shift the nature of the discussion, you must first acknowledge and appreciate their current mindset. Key to signaling to someone that we're truly listening is for us to adopt our own mindset of curiosity. Curiosity is when we display a genuine sense of interest and wonder at what's being communicated. When we're curious, the other person senses it and will be more forthcoming. And finally, when we're curious, we limit our interior distractions, suspend our own judgments, and place our entire attention on the speaker. We quiet our internal monologue and stop worrying about how we'll respond.

We make ourselves open to really hearing what the other person has to say, connecting with their thoughts and ideas. Once we make that connection, we can listen as our authentic selves, and when it is time to respond, we can do so genuinely without preconception.

Listening with genuine interest isn't always easy.

How can you tell when you're "false listening?"

What can you do to snap out of it when you find yourself drifting away from active listening?

But if you allow for silence, eventually the person with whom you are conversing will break it.
Option 7:
This option is incorrect. While there is great value in allowing for pauses and silences in a conversation, unresponsiveness on the part of the listener will effectively end the communication. Active listening requires responses, even nonverbal ones.
Option 8:
This option is incorrect. Part of active listening is allowing the speaker to express themselves in a way that’s comfortable and natural for them. While it may seem efficient to cut off a speaker who seems to be digressing, the tangent may be their way of getting to a specific point.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Listening to Cocreate. [Video description ends]
HOST: Business conversations have different purposes than, say, discussing the day's news over dinner or asking the kids about their day at school. At work, the most powerful conversations are intended to lead to outcomes and solutions. They’re intended to build on the ideas and contributions of all parties. Ideally, one plus one will equal three. Otherwise, why have the conversation to begin with? To make them greater than the sum of their parts requires identifying methods for making conversations more powerful.

PAUL SHERMAN: Jennifer is the member of a customer service team at a property and casualty insurance company. She was assigned to work with Mark, somebody brand new to the company to create an agenda for their team's upcoming offsite. She asked me to sit in on their first meeting just to give her some feedback on her listening. The meeting started out with Jennifer saying, "Mark, I want to acknowledge that you’re new here.

And that even though you’re new, you have an equal voice in this process. We’re partners in putting this agenda together." Mark then began. "Jennifer, let’s brainstorm the options for the offsite." Jennifer’s response. "Great, Mark. Let’s brainstorm the options, and let’s flipchart them as well." Now what Jennifer used here was a listening strategy called 'Yes And'ing. She yessed what Mark had suggested, which encourages further participation and, in the end, builds on his idea. What that does is creates innovation and creativity.

Mark then chimed in, saying, "You know something, Jennifer? Instead of us evaluating each option as we go along, let’s go ahead and brainstorm all of the potential areas. We can go back, create an evaluation criteria, and then assess each item against that criteria." Jennifer’s response. "Mark, what I’m hearing you say is you’d like us to get all the brainstorming done first without any evaluation, and then we can go back, come up with some criteria and assess each option against that criteria." Am I hearing you correctly? Mark nods affirmatively.

This is a listening strategy called summarizing and checking in. She summarized what she heard Mark say, and then she actually checked in for an actual affirmation or a correction. Now it was Jennifer's turn to take the lead on the conversation. Next, she said, "Mark, what are some of your ideas for the offsite?" Notice what Jennifer did at this point. She asked a question. Rather than putting her opinion out on the table first, she asked a question of her colleague. And not only that, the nature of the question that she asked was an open-ended question.

Open-ended questions require more than just a one word answer. They open up communication. Well, they came up with some wonderful ideas for the offsite, and a month later, it went off without a hitch. HOST: The first method for making conversations more powerful is building on ideas. Good listeners can take in others ideas, opinions, and suggestions and build on them to co-create or collaborate on the best possible solutions.

One powerful tool for doing so comes from the world of improvizational comedy and theater. It is called “Yes, and...” In practice, to “Yes, and...,” the listener first affirms what the speaker has said, and then offers a modification or addition. This allows the concept or idea being discussed to evolve. When practicing, “Yes, and...,” the listener finds something in what the speaker has said that can be agreed with and aligned to.

This legitimizes the idea so that the speaker feels seen and heard. And then you can offer your perspective - “Yes, revising that step in the process might simplify production and we might also reduce the waste by...” And so on. Good listeners can draw out a speaker. They do this by acknowledging what the speaker has said and encouraging them to share more. Think about responses like: “Wow, that’s an interesting idea... tell me more.” This could be followed up by “what else?”

Of course, statements like these need to be genuine. You really do need to want to hear more. Otherwise it will feel hollow and insincere. A final method to look at is what might be called the “have you considered?” method. How do we get our opinions on the table while still having others feel that they're being listened to? This is where the question “have you considered?” comes in. It starts with beginning by summarizing what the speaker has just said. Find something in what they have said that you can support.

This will make the speaker feel heard. You can then follow this by asking “have you considered?” and then offering your viewpoint.

For example, something like “opening up that market is a great idea.

Have you considered creating new products specifically to appeal to it?”

Conversations about work are ultimately collaboration. They're about people talking together to create and improve ideas. By listening closely and nurturing these conversations, you make them more powerful.

Think about how you approach work conversations and their ebb and flow.

In what ways do you treat them as a way of working together?

How might you consciously approach them in the future?

How can you be a better collaborator?

6. Video: Designing the Listening Alliance (bs_acm35_a02_enus_05)

To create the best possible outcomes in workplace conversations, effective listening requires a partnership between all parties involved. While this partnership can develop organically or by chance when everyone's committed to effective listening, it’s a better practice to consciously design a listening alliance. In this video, you'll learn the benefits of creating an alliance and steps for designing one.
recognize the steps for designing a listening alliance
[Video description begins] Topic title: Designing the Listening Alliance. [Video description ends]
PAUL SHERMAN: Andrea is the member of a finance team at a health care institution. Now, the executive team tasked her to form a cross-functional team to cut 10% out of their operating budget. Well, she conducted a session among the team and they came up with a set of recommendations. Martha, a member of the quality organization, she was unable to attend the meeting. Andrea came to me really exasperated.

Paul, she said, "When I briefed Martha after the meeting, Martha was really upset." And she said that she couldn't abide by the decisions that were made by the cross-functional team that the government agencies would never condone what was being recommended. I let her speak her opinions and I let her vent. At the end of it, I explained to her, "Yes, Martha, all of the points that you raised had been looked at by the cross-functional team." And even though those points are there, we decided the risk is worth taking. We're going to move forward.

Well, with that, Martha stormed out of the room and said, “You all just don’t get it.” Andrea says to me, “Paul, where to?” Well, what I explained to Andrea was that she and Martha were both in an entrenched position, that Andrea was entrenched in the position of the cross-functional team, and Martha was entrenched in her own position from the quality organization. When people are entrenched in their own positions, it's very hard for them to listen to one another. I offered Andrea the following, which she actually took me up on.

After a cooling off period, Andrea sat down with Martha and acknowledged the fact that they were at an impasse. Most importantly, what Andrea did was to acknowledge her role in creating the impasse and the environment that had developed. Blame is the Kryptonite to listening, and Martha was feeling blamed in their original conversation. Andrea acknowledged her role and then asked Martha to start again from scratch.

But first, looking at what their mutual goals were. They identified their mutual goals, then looked at some potential solutions. And in fact came up with solutions that the original cross-functional team hadn't even thought of. They brought these ideas to the cross-functional team and consensus was reached. HOST: Ultimately, the responsibility for good listening falls squarely on the shoulders of the listener.

However, to create the best possible outcomes in workplace conversations, effective listening requires a partnership between all parties involved. While in some cases, when everyone's committed to effective listening, this partnership can develop organically or by chance, it's a better practice to consciously design what might be called a listening alliance. Designing a listening alliance is an intentional conversation with the express goal of creating explicit parameters for how everyone in a conversation can agree to put good listening into practice.

In other words, having a conversation about how to best listen before delving into the conversation itself. Let's look at the steps necessary for designing a listening alliance. The first of these steps is to set the scene. Everyone should agree that they want to create the best possible outcomes from any given conversation. So before jumping into the conversation, they can set themselves up for success by agreeing on what good listening looks like and how they want to listen to each other.

You can then jump into a discussion of what effective listening looks like, how it contrasts with poor listening, and how to call out poor listening when it occurs. Further, you can discuss how you'll know that you're truly listening to each other and how to productively disagree. The next step is to create a deep democracy. Deep democracy, a term coined by psychologist Arnold Mindell, is the concept that all voices in a conversation be heard and feel heard. This is important because the best outcomes require considering all points of view.

Everyone has a role in solving the puzzle. That being said, while all viewpoints need to be considered, it doesn't necessarily mean that all viewpoints need to be agreed with. Otherwise you will end up in endless discussions and won’t move forward. When differences of opinion are present, it is important that people feel heard as otherwise they may irrationally hold on to their positions even when more optimal solutions are offered. Good listening entails communicating a genuine empathy and appreciation for what others are communicating.

A final step is to acknowledge the value of interrupting. It seems counterintuitive, but interrupting genuinely is a fundamental listening skill. It's how we interrupt that determines whether it's part of good listening. It's important that it's done tactfully and respectfully. Consider when it's appropriate to interrupt, say, someone's rambling. They're trying to make their point but are having trouble getting there. That is an ideal time for interruption. Begin by slowly raising your hand. This signals to the speaker that you are going to say something.

Think about the power of nonverbal signs. As your hand goes up, say something like, “may I interrupt a moment?” This is respectful in that you are asking permission. Once the speaker grants permission, communicate what you're experiencing. For example, “I’m having some trouble understanding your point and really want to ‘get it.’ Can you try to summarize it for me in one sentence?” You may also ask them to bottom line what they're saying. Interrupting is also a valuable listening tool in communicating with someone who continues to make the same point over and over again.

This is the broken record. Here the underlying issue is that the speaker doesn't feel that they're being heard. They're hungry for validation of their point of view or they're so entrenched in their view that they feel the need to continue to reinforce it. Again, politely and respectfully, ask to interrupt. Summarize what you think their point is and ask them to confirm. This shows them you've heard them while emphasizing that you do indeed get it and the group can move on.

Designing a listening alliance sets ground rules for conversations that allow everyone to take part, knowing they'll have the opportunity to express their ideas and be heard. And that makes for good, effective listening.

Think about the type of listening that normally goes on in your team’s meetings.

What are the ground rules?

Have they been set arbitrarily or through a democratic process?

How can you assure everyone can feel both listened to and heard?

Question 1: Multiple Choice
What are three methods you can employ for making conversations more powerful?

Options:
1.
The building-on-ideas method
2.
The acknowledging and encouraging method
3.
The “have you considered?” method
4.
The "stop now and listen to me” method
5.
The “yes, we get it” method
Answer
1.
The building-on-ideas method
2.
The acknowledging and encouraging method
3.
The “have you considered?” method
Feedback:
Option 1:
This option is correct. Good listeners can take in others’ ideas, opinions, and suggestions and build on them to cocreate, or collaborate on, the best possible solutions. One powerful tool for doing so is called "yes, and…," where the listener first affirms what a speaker has said, and then offers a modification or addition. This allows the concept or idea being discussed to evolve.
Option 2:
This option is correct. Good listeners can draw out a speaker by adopting a method of acknowledging what the speaker has said and encouraging them to share more. Consider responses like “Wow, that’s an interesting idea. Tell me more.” Of course, statements like these need to be genuine – you really do need to want to hear more.
Option 3:
This option is correct. The question “have you considered?” helps you express your opinions while still having others feel that they're being listened to. It starts with summarizing what the speaker has just said. Find something in what they have said that you can support; this will make the speaker feel heard. You can then follow this by asking, “have you considered?” and then offering your viewpoint.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. Good listeners let speakers talk and fully explain themselves before responding. A better approach would be to wait until the speaker is finished and then ask, “have you considered…?”
Option 5:
This option is incorrect. While it’s certainly possible to become weary of listening – especially if a speaker begins to repeat themselves or focus on an already-accepted point – a good listener is able to handle this by applying something like the building-on-ideas method.

This option is correct. One of the first steps is to set the scene. Everyone should agree that they want to create the best possible outcomes from any given conversation. Before jumping into the conversation, they can set themselves up for success by agreeing on what good listening looks like and how they want to listen to each other.
Option 2:
This option is correct. Deep democracy is the concept that all voices in a conversation should be and feel heard. This is important because the best outcomes require considering all points of view. Everyone has a role in solving the puzzle. But while all viewpoints need to be considered, it doesn’t necessarily mean that all viewpoints need to be agreed with. Otherwise, you will end up in endless discussions and won’t move forward.
Option 3:
This option is correct. One step for developing a listening alliance is to acknowledge the value of interrupting. It seems counterintuitive, but interrupting genuinely is a fundamental listening skill. But it’s important that it’s done tactfully and respectfully. Consider when it’s appropriate to interrupt.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. Equal time isn’t something to insist upon in a listening alliance. Some people may simply not have anything to add to a given conversation. The idea of a deep democracy is instead that all voices wishing to contribute are heard and respected.
Option 5:
This option is incorrect. While this may seem like an ideal goal to reach for, it’s impossible to achieve in practice. While a group should encourage and reward using good judgment within any conversation, it’s not a step in creating a listening alliance.

HOST: Let’s review what you learned in this course. Active listening requires honing a few skills, including asking questions; using verbal and nonverbal prompts; naming it, summarizing, echoing; and knowing when to allow for silence. You explored how to demonstrate genuine interest by examining your motives, mindset and attitude; adopting a mindset of curiosity; and limiting your interior distractions while suspending judgment.

You learned methods for making your conversations more powerful. These are building on the ideas of others; acknowledging and encouraging the speaker to elaborate; and applying the “have you considered?” approach for suggesting a different approach.

Finally, you examine the steps for designing a listening alliance, setting the scene; creating a deep democracy; and acknowledging the value of respectfully interrupting when necessary.

active listening	A set of skills that aid in communication. It requires focusing your attention on what a speaker is saying, how they’re saying it, their facial expressions, and their gestures, while also using your own verbal and nonverbal cues to encourage the speaker and communicate and clarify your understanding.
curiosity mindset	A genuine sense of interest and wonder at what’s being communicated. Involves limiting interior distractions, suspending judgment, and placing full attention on the speaker.
echoing	An active listening skill related to summarizing. The listener takes the last couple of words spoken and repeats them, either in a statement or posed as a question.
listening alliance	An intentional conversation with the express goal of creating explicit parameters for how everyone in a conversation can agree to put good listening into practice.
naming it	An active listening skill that involves articulating what one is sensing from a speaker beyond their words, indicative of their underlying message and meaning.
nonverbal prompts	Body language cues, like nodding and eye contact, that indicate whether or not a listener is paying full attention.
