2. Video: Respecting the Needs of Your Audience (bs_acm37_a02_enus_02)

One of the most important skills in the workplace is the ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of others. If your communication skills are weak, you’re ultimately unlikely to be successful. In this video, you'll learn methods for considering your audience's needs for successfully communicating with them.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Respecting the Needs of Your Audience. [Video description ends]
HOST: One of the most important skills in the modern workplace is the ability to communicate effectively. As a business professional, you need good communication skills to collaborate with others and get work done. If your communication skills are weak, your colleagues might not take you seriously, you may appear untrustworthy, and you're unlikely to be successful.

When you communicate - whether to sell a product, pitch an idea, or for some other reason - your goal is to motivate your audience to take the action you want. However, if you don't know who your audience is, your messaging won't be as well received as it could be. In addition, if people interpret your message differently to how you intended, it can lead to misunderstanding, hurt feelings, and disengagement. Luckily, there are methods you can use to consider your audience while communicating with them.

The first method is to know who you're talking to ahead of time. To know your audience better, you can start by researching their demographics. Delve beyond the basics and uncover their backgrounds and communication preferences. Also, assess your audience's prior knowledge and build on it. For example, if the audience already knows a lot about the topic you're talking about, you won't need to cover the fundamental principles in depth. But if the audience is entirely unfamiliar with the topic, you may need to provide greater detail. It's also important to recognize your audience's category.

For example, is your audience made up of executives, technicians, end-users, or experts? Your communication style with an executive, who has power to approve a project, is likely to vary from your style with an end-user, such as a customer. As a communicator, you also need to know why the audience needs to hear from you and to be aware of the purpose of your communication. For example, maybe the audience wants to find out how your new product works or why they should buy it? Aligning your communication with a purpose gives you an opportunity to offer real value to your audience.

This helps to make it credible, instill trust, and create a positive impact. Jennifer Nash: Marcy's boss asked her to create a 10 minute presentation for the CEO. Marcy was super excited to have the opportunity to present to the CEO. So she stayed up all night creating this beautiful PowerPoint deck with 30 slides, lots of information and graphics. During the meeting with the CEO,

Marcy started telling the CEO all about her slides going through each slide in very minute detail, and all of sudden the CEO stopped her and asked her to tell him in one sentence very succinctly, "What is the purpose of this presentation and what do you want me to know?" Marcy couldn't do that. And the CEO got up and walked out of the room. Marcie made a mistake that I often see clients make, not adapting the information they have to share to their audience's needs.

From this experience, Marcy learned two very important things. First, she needed to pay closer attention to what her boss was asking her to do. Second, she learned that surprises are not good. She needed to run the presentation by her boss before she showed it to the CEO. HOST: Another method you can use when communicating is to listen to your audience. Listening shows you understand your audience and empathize with them and it demonstrates that you care.

Your communication shouldn't be one-sided, so provide your audience with opportunities to communicate with you. Consider including a Q&A session in your presentations and encourage people to ask questions. Invite diverse perspectives and make everyone feel welcome. Keep the communication interactive. When you've researched your audience, identified your communication's purpose, and provided listening opportunities, you can adjust your style as needed.

After all, you want to ensure the message you send out is the message that's received. So, focus on your audience's reactions to your words. Make sure your tone is appropriate and that your word choice isn't biased. Adjust your message to your audience's preferred communication style. Tell a story, make a personal connection, or provide facts and figures, as appropriate.

Think about the last time you addressed a meeting or made a presentation. What worked and what didn't? How much thought did you put into tailoring your approach to the audience? Taking the time to research your audience from multiple perspectives will enhance your communication and make you more effective at work.

3. Video: Choosing the Right Message Format (bs_acm37_a02_enus_03)

Not everyone works regular business hours, checks messages throughout the day, or works in the same time zone. Choosing the right format for communicating will help you get your message across. Choose the wrong format may mean your message gets overlooked. In this video, you'll explore the appropriate formats for communicating in a given work situation.

recognize the appropriate format for communicating in a given work situation
[Video description begins] Topic title: Choosing the Right Message Format. [Video description ends]
Host: In the modern workplace, not everyone works regular business hours, checks messages throughout the day, and is in the same time zone. This can easily lead to misunderstanding and miscommunication between colleagues. To avoid this, it's essential to choose the right communication formats when you're interacting with others. Choosing the right format for your communications, either written or oral, will help you get your message across quickly and impactfully. Choose the wrong format and your message may get overlooked.

There are different formats you can choose depending on your specific purpose and situation. You can use informal formats when you want to establish a personal connection with somebody. Making a personal connection can help you get to know people better. One informal written format you can use is an instant message or a text message. Choose this approach to send time-sensitive or urgent messages that require a speedy response. Make sure your message is brief and has a clear purpose.

And, of course, avoid messaging or texting during meetings or working sessions unless you have permission to do so from your manager. An informal oral format is the chance meetup. Face-to face meetups are useful as they help build trust. Your facial expressions and tone of voice can help draw and keep attention and emphasize the core message you want to convey. Meetups in different environments, such as outdoors, can energize employees. When dealing with larger audiences or to communicate matters of public interest, you can use semi-formal communication formats based on organizational roles.

One semi-formal format is the written memo or email. You can use memos to pass on information about functional and operational procedures and business dealings in your organization. However, email is a more popular option. Email can be used for large scale, individual, or team-based communication. Use the To, Cc, and Bcc lines carefully in your emails. In general, if for some reason you can't openly include someone as a recipient, it's better to send them a separate email or forward them the relevant email separately, with an explanation.

To ensure the meaning of your email is clear and that no one misinterprets your message, observe good email etiquette: include a clear subject line; adopt a professional tone; check grammar, spelling, and punctuation; and keep your email as short as possible. Other semi-formal formats include team meetings - either in-person or online - and phone calls. With these oral formats, try to build a rapport with your audience. Be friendly, take an interest in them, and respect their time. When you schedule a meeting, prepare for it in advance - be ready with the right presentation tools and visual aids.

During the meeting, time yourself to ensure you cover all the key points within the allotted timeframe. Take care with your appearance too, including your posture, outfit, and grooming. Remember to back up all oral conversations with written communication wherever possible, to confirm the key takeaways. Jennifer Nash: Brian and Geneva are coworkers. Brian has two little kids and he does bath time for them every night. Geneva sent Brian a slack message while he was doing bath time with his kids.

When Brian didn't respond right away, Geneva sent him another 9 messages in a row. After Brian put the kids to bed, he happened to log back in on his laptop and he saw all these missed messages from Geneva. Brian felt that if the situation was that urgent that Geneva should have picked up the phone and directly called him. Geneva's poor communication with Brian caused tension in their relationship and it strained their communication. Geneva could have decided, was this issue really important? Was it really urgent?

And then decide what communication method that she needed to use based on her answers to those two questions. Host: Finally, to communicate precise and consistent messages, you can use formal communication formats. Formal formats are generally best for exchanging official information between people who are at different levels and ranks within an organization. One widely used method of formal communication is the written report. Reports can convey different kinds of information. When creating a report, it's important to ensure it has a clear objective and a sound structure.

Two other widely used methods of formal communication are one-on-one meetings and presentations. You can use one-on-meetings to provide feedback or address concerns for a specific employee, and for project discussions. Formal presentations are effective for large audiences, like at conferences. They're also useful for pitching a new idea or proposal and for delivering training. To create an impactful presentation, include visual aids to help you convey your message and pay attention to your body language.

Think about the way you like to communicate at work - with your team members, your boss, or your clients. What are the most effective formats for your communication? How do they differ based on the message and the audience?

5. Video: Navigating Different Communication Styles (bs_acm37_a02_enus_04)

Building a flexible communication style is essential to working relationships and performance. By flexing your workplace communication style, you can become more agile and successful at work. In this video, you'll be learn how different communication styles can drive desired work outcomes.

recognize communication styles that drive desired outcomes
[Video description begins] Topic title: Navigating Different Communication Styles. [Video description ends]
Many of us focus on what we're saying, not on how we're presenting our message to others. We often stick with a fixed style of communication. However, building a flexible communication style is essential, as our style can impact our working relationships and performance. By varying your workplace communication style, you can become more agile and successful at work.

Let's look at an example. Sam, who works in marketing, has a meeting with finance where he hopes to gain financial support for an upcoming social media promotion. He shows his finance counterpart a beautiful, glossy, illustrated design sample while using rich, emotionally focused language. The finance counterpart turns down the request. Why? Because Sam didn't speak the right "language." He didn't provide hard data about the expected audience, the cost of acquiring a new customer, or overall expected revenue gains. If, like Sam, you always use your preferred communication style regardless of your audience, others may perceive you as having a narrow view that limits your effectiveness.

While using other communication styles may not feel natural to you, it gets easier over time. Understanding how you prefer to communicate can impact how you lead, solve problems, and collaborate in the workplace. There are four main styles of communication. The first style, social or personal communication, enhances collaboration. Those who have a social communication style express their emotions openly and connect with others on a personal level. They're inclusive, making sure all voices are heard.

They also prioritize listening over speaking, and ask questions aimed at understanding. This style is best to convey empathy and helps to improve relationships and morale among team members. A person with this style gets counted on to be a team player and to play the role of mediator between conflicting parties. Use this style when working closely with other people and to resolve workplace disputes. The second style of communication is analytical, evaluative communication.

This style leans toward problem-solving and emphasizes precision, especially in terms of data and metrics. People with this style prioritize observation over speaking and hard evidence over opinions. Those with an analytical style like to understand how things work. Use this style when you need to back up decisions with clear metrics for measuring levels of achievement; identify patterns or trends; or unearth root causes of issues; have direct and concise conversations and answer hard questions.

The third style is functional, task-oriented communication. This style focuses on execution and getting things done. Someone with this communication style concentrates on both the minor and major details of a task, and how to implement a plan or strategy.

They prioritize speaking over listening, and processes over people. This functional style helps you execute tasks consistently. You can use it when you need to factor in numerous details without jeopardizing delivery; get things done on a definite timeline and within the estimated budget; and set, execute, and maintain plans, tasks, and deliverables.

Finally, the fourth communication style is intuitive, expressive communication. This style provides inspiration and is visionary. It aims to change the status quo and inspire people's hearts and minds. The intuitive style prioritizes ideas over data, purpose over process, and provides a 'big picture' view of a problem or task. You can use this style when you need to brainstorm various possibilities and do some out-of-the-box thinking. It helps you convey the 'why' of a problem or task, rather than the 'how.' It can help you to come up with the best answers that help the most people, and to propose new and innovative solutions.

Which communication styles do you tend to use the most? Would you be more effective if you varied your style occasionally? Good communicators are aware of their own preferred style and that of their audience and are willing to adapt their style to different people and situations.

This ability increases the success of their collaborations, reduces interpersonal conflict, and produces connected teams.

6. Video: Communicating Well in Difficult Conversations (bs_acm37_a02_enus_05)

When conversations become sensitive or heated, managing your emotions will help you stay calm and work to find a solution. In this video, you'll explore communication strategies for handling difficult conversations effectively.

identify communication strategies to handle difficult conversations effectively
[Video description begins] Topic title: Communicating Well in Difficult Conversations. [Video description ends]

Jennifer Nash: Angela and Roxanne are startup cofounders. They enjoyed early success, growing their business to 7 figures in eight years. But recently there have been some cracks simmering under the surface, and Angela and Roxanne have gotten to the point where they're not even speaking to one another anymore. Angela wants to grow the business. Roxanne doesn't want to let go of the purse strings, and so they're not able to find common ground and how they want to move the business forward.
Angela and Roxanne suffer from a common problem that many cofounders experience. Their emotions are running in the show rather than their rational brains taking over. It's gotten so bad that each side has hired a lawyer to break up the partnership and divide the assets of the company. The real loser here in all of this scenario are the underserved population that Angela and Roxanne Startup actually provides care for. Host: Difficult situations arise often in the workplace. Maybe a team member you manage isn't performing well, or you've been passed over for a promotion.

You know you need to speak up, but negotiating such conversations can be challenging, and they're often put off. However, the consequences of avoiding difficult conversations can be severe, so it's better to deal with these situations head-on. When a conversation is heated, managing your emotions will help you - and the other person - stay calm and work together to find a solution. You can use communication strategies to handle difficult conversations effectively. The first strategy you can use is to keep listening.

Try to develop a listener's mindset. You can achieve this by being fully present in the conversation. So, turn away from your computer and your phone and other distractions. Don't interrupt the other person. Let them have their say - but don't rush to judgment. Concentrate on what they're saying and allow them time to react and ask questions. Relax and listen carefully to their views, opinions, and feelings. Ask them follow-up questions and summarize or paraphrase what they say to check your understanding.

Also, pay attention to your body language: maintain eye contact, adopt a relaxed posture, and uncross your arms. Listening openly and attentively to others helps cultivate trust. You'll likely notice from your own experiences that the more connected you feel to someone, the more you tend to trust them, and the easier it becomes to talk. A sense of safety encourages people to take risks and speak up, leading to successful collaboration and teamwork. In the end, everyone benefits.

A second strategy you can use is to acknowledge both your emotions and the other person's. Conflict situations might work you up emotionally, leading to uncomfortable reactions and making conversation challenging. You can acknowledge people's emotions by asking open-ended questions such as, "Did something I say upset you?" Also, observe the other party's body language - such as their posture suddenly stiffening - to understand why and when they feel upset. Demonstrate empathy.

Acknowledge the conversation is difficult for both of you and try to see things from the other's perspective. Finally, give them the chance to say what they need to say before you reach a conclusion. A third strategy is to state the disagreement neutrally. Let's say you're arguing a point with someone, and you start your contribution by saying "You always..." They'll instantly think you're blaming them. As a result, they'll be on the defensive and likely won't hear what you have to say next.

Using neutral, impersonal language helps you get your message across more successfully. Word choice and tone can either escalate or de-escalate a problem. Other ways to keep neutral include making sure you have your facts straight before you begin a difficult conversation. Anticipate questions and think about how you'll answer them. Don't engage in negative behavior, such as trading angry comments or insults, and focus on the issue at hand. Finally, a fourth strategy is to be ready to negotiate.

Negotiation is sometimes seen as a sign of giving in or defeat in conversations, but it can direct you to potential solutions and help you overcome difficult and uncomfortable issues. Ask your manager for help, if needed, to deal with a particularly difficult situation or to find mutually agreeable solutions. You get the best results when you negotiate with empathy. For example, when delivering difficult news, you can soften the blow by beginning with the words, "I'm sorry about this; but..." Try to build an alliance with your counterpart in a difficult situation.

You'll likely gain more by tapping into their good will than by blindly pressing ahead with your own solutions. Think about a difficult conversation you had at work recently. How did you handle it? How might the result have been better by using a different strategy? Handling difficult conversations requires skill, empathy, and courage. But it's worth the effort. It makes you a better communicator - and helps you operate more efficiently at work.
