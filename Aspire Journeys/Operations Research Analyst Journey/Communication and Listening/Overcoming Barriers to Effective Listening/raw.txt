HOST: Barriers to effective listening are always there, all around you. Now, there are obvious external environmental factors: background noise, interruptions, and a myriad of other unwanted distractions. But even more subtle and difficult to navigate are the internal inhibitors to your attention: your preconceived judgments and opinions, and even your own emotional responses. PAUL SHERMAN: I'm Paul Sherman, cofounder of Ask What Matters, a coaching and training company focused on individual, team, and organizational performance. I'm here with you today because I firmly believe that effective listening is key to success at work, at home, and in life.

In this course, I want to address with you the common barriers that block communications and how you can overcome them to be a better, more effective, and more empathetic listener. In this course, you'll learn to recognize how good listening habits can increase your effectiveness in the workplace and become aware of listening tendencies that interfere with effective communication. You'll also learn to recognize strategies for maintaining focus while listening and identify ways to effectively listen when your emotions are activated.

2. Video: Why Listen? (bs_acm35_a01_enus_02)

At the end of the day, our job performance is based on both what we produce and how we produce it. Good listening is critical to productivity. In this video, you'll explore the benefits of good listening habits.
recognize the benefits of good listening habits in improving your performance in the workplace
[Video description begins] Topic title: Why Listen?. [Video description ends]
HOST: At the end of the day, our job performance is based on both what we produce and how we produce it. The "what" part is the quantity, quality, and timeliness of the results we produce. The "how" part is the strength of the relationships we build along the way. Good listening is critical to both of "what" and the "how. "Let's start with the "what." While everyone has their own subject matter expertise, we only know what we know, and we aren't always aware of what areas of knowledge we might be lacking.

Our colleagues, though, have a whole host of different perspectives and experiences in any given area. While we may not always agree with them, it's important to at least consider alternative points of view with an open mind. No one has all the answers, even those who think they do. Practicing good listening skills allows for being genuinely open to other points of view and creating the best possible outcomes. To assume you have all the answers without considering others' input is arrogant and short sighted.

It's all part of addressing of "what" of your success. Clearly, it's important to recognize the benefits of good listening habits in increasing your work performance. First, listening consciously adds to your knowledge. Listening actively helps you absorb and process information. Further, it helps to compare with your own existing knowledge. Engaging in continuous learning and sharpening your skills is essential to both job performance and career growth. Good listening habits encourage both. Further, listening actively heightens your productivity.

Paying close attention and maintaining your focus while listening helps to get greater returns on your time. Active listening skills like paraphrasing help you avoid misunderstandings that can waste your time and energy. And then, effectively listening for details enhances problem-solving. With good listening habits, you'll have better information to review before proposing solutions and making decisions. Looking more closely at the "how" gets to the heart of how poor listening negatively impacts you and your company's culture. Think about the last time that someone talked over you or "at" you.

Perhaps they ignored you or discounted what you had to say without truly considering your viewpoint. Now, think about someone who demonstrated genuine interest in what you had to say. Maybe they asked clarifying questions or acknowledged the validity of your contribution. Which of these people do you want to be? What kind of culture enhances productivity, creativity, and innovation? From a "how" perspective, good listening habits build trust and cohesive bonds among teammates.

They help avoid conflict and encourage the free and open flow of information and ideas. Think about how listening currently impacts both of "what" and "how" of your job performance.

How can you and your team better incorporate good listening habits?

3. Video: What Gets in the Way of Good Listening? (bs_acm35_a01_enus_03)

Distractions are all around you, all the time. Both physical and mental, they’re the greatest barriers to good listening. In this video, you will learn about the types of barriers you need to overcome in developing good listening habits.
identify barriers that interfere with effective communication
[Video description begins] Topic title: What Gets in the Way of Good Listening?. [Video description ends]
HOST: Your phone is buzzing. Your IM is pinging at you. Two people are arguing over by the water cooler. There's a delivery driver at the door. Your daughter didn't feel well when she went to school this morning. Your boss turned down your time-off request. Distractions are all around you, all the time. Both physical and mental, they're the greatest barriers to good listening. Let's look at some major examples.

Among the most basic barriers to good listening are physical and auditory distractions, where you're literally not hearing what the other person is saying due to the physical environment in which the communication is occurring. Aside from the obvious buzzing phones and loud coworkers, consider a situation like this. You're in line the local café, with its typical background noise and activity. You're just getting a cup of coffee. A colleague behind you in line tells you about a new date for a deliverable on your project. You nod in agreement.

A week later your colleague is upset because you missed the deadline. It turns out that you misheard them in the café line. In the spirit of efficiency, you conducted business on the fly in a poor setting for effective communication. Work is filled with time pressure and there's a constant temptation to engage in multitasking. On the surface, it seems efficient, but in reality, it's a barrier and has a negative impact on the quality of our work. Among other things, multitasking encourages - even requires - suboptimal listening.

Suppose you're on a video conference call with multiple colleagues. You're doing your best to pay attention to the meeting. "Ping...ping...ping...," email after email arrives. "Beep, beep, beep..." goes your instant messenger. Frustrated and overwhelmed, you begin responding. And then someone in the meeting asks for your input. But you've lost track of the conversation. This is awkward, and bad for communication. Another major barrier is when you find yourself formulating your response instead of paying attention to what more is being said.

As the old saying goes, "listening is defined as waiting to talk." Someone begins to speak. After the first couple of sentences, you might find yourself putting it through your analytical filter based on your own knowledge and past experiences. You form an opinion and begin to generate a response. But while you're doing that, you miss the rest of what's being said, so your response is premature. There are two negative consequences of this.

First, in terms of the "what" of your job performance, you've missed information critical to the situation. And second, you can potentially annoy the person you're interacting with. They sense you haven't been listening to everything they have to say. Another barrier is discounting the speaker, which sometimes shows itself in confusing the message with the messenger. People tend to think in stories; it helps us find meaning in the world around us. But in creating stories, we make assumptions - assumptions that may or may not be valid.

They can cause us to discount or ignore what we're hearing. "He's too young to have anything important to say." "She may have experience, but she doesn't understand how we do things around here." "The last time we paid attention to him, things fell apart." Sound familiar? You can miss a lot that way. Finally, we come to the barrier of being so attached to our own opinions that it's like having blinders on. It can blind us to other peoples' input.

Suppose you're an expert in a particular area. You're asked to convene a crossfunctional working group to solve a problem impacting the entire organization. Buy-in among the key stakeholders is critical. You're very clear about the solution. You know you have the answer. The group gathers in a conference room for a conversation. You go through the motions by asking everyone to put their ideas out on the table and you record them on the flipchart, all the while knowing that you already have the answer.

Once all of the ideas have been presented, including your own, you begin to discuss them. But running through your mind is, "I need to convince them of my solution." You're so convinced that your way is the right way that there's no room for an alternative, even one that builds on your idea. You spend the entire meeting arguing for your approach. Everyone else might as well have stayed home. Clearly, this is no way to do business. Barriers to good listening are also barriers to good ideas, good communication, and good work.

Take a moment and think about your own listening habits.

What barriers do you erect around your listening?

What barriers do you regularly encounter from others?

How do these affect your communication and effectiveness at work?

5. Video: Maintaining Your Listening Focus (bs_acm35_a01_enus_04)

Physical, mental, and emotional distractions are the root cause of poor listening. In this video, you'll explore strategies you can deploy for maintaining focus in less-than-optimal listening conditions and distracting environments.
recognize strategies for maintaining focus while listening
[Video description begins] Topic title: Maintaining Your Listening Focus. [Video description ends]
HOST: Your phone buzzes. You just remembered your kid's dental appointment is at 3:00 p.m., so you need to be out the door by 2:30. This speaker's voice is really monotone. And they just said something you need to respond to right now. How should you phrase it? Think about it. What's the best way to reply to that thing they said two minutes ago? Physical, mental, and emotional distractions are the root cause of poor listening.

The antidote, then, is to develop strategies for maintaining focus while listening and keeping your attention on the speaker. While this may seem obvious, the fundamental factor for good listening is an optimal setting for paying attention. Can you actually hear the other person? Is there potential for likely interruptions? Is there enough privacy given the topic being discussed? Is there enough time to do the topic justice?

Bottom line is, don't be afraid to take charge of determining when and where your conversations are taking place. And there are factors other than the physical. The secret weapon for paying attention is being curious. A curious mindset allows for a state of wonder, of fascination. When we're curious, there's little room for distracting thoughts and reactions to what others are saying or doing. Instead of paying attention to our own inner dialogue, we're paying deep attention to what's going on outside of our heads. When we listen with genuine curiosity, we can hit the pause button on our distracting thoughts like

"I once had an experience just like that," or "here's why that's a bad idea," or "I hope I don't hit a lot of traffic on the way home." We keep our attention on the speaker, what they're saying, and how they're saying it. A related strategy for maintaining focus is the simple art of asking probing questions. Not only does this redirect your attention to the speaker, but it also shows them that you're listening to what they're saying. Probing questions are opened-ended.

They're questions like, "What was that like?" or "How do you feel about this?," "What else?" or "Can you tell me more?" However, beware of leading questions, those that intentionally try to pull the speaker into your point of view. Think about how you feel when you hear questions like, "Don't you think that...?" or "Don't you agree?" A question like "When do you think we should start?" assumes that you will start. "When should we stop?" equally assumes that you should stop. That's not listening; it's presuming.

PAUL SHERMAN: Mark's the member of the Legal Team at a pharmaceutical company. Now he was receiving feedback that people thought he was a poor listener. They said that he interrupted and also that he was very quick to judge at the people's ideas. We had a discussion about this. And he said, Paul I am super aware of these behaviours. But I am a trained lawyer, this is how my mind works. When Mark and I discussed the situation, we talked about two tools for him to use.

The first one we call "the 2% rule." And what's that? When Mark was having a reflex reaction to wanting to criticize somebody's statement, what I ask him to do is to think about if just 2% of what that person were saying had validity, what value would it bring to the conversation? We also worked for the second tool, we called that one "WAIT".

Now WAIT is an acronym for "Why Am I Talking?" Mark put a bunch of posted notes in his work environment and even on his computer wallpaper with the acronym "WAIT." That way he had a visual quiew. So when he was tempted to intterupted, he would see his visual queue. It would stop him from his reflux reaction and then allow him to chime in when the time was more appropriate. Mark then reported to me, not only to people think he was a better listener. But the quality of the work that was coming out of their work team discussions actually improved.

HOST: A final strategy in support of maintaining your focus is one you're likely familiar with, active listening. Asking questions, as we've just explored, is a key active listening technique. Paraphrasing is another staple of active listening. Paraphrasing is verbally repeating back to the speaker what you've just heard them say, but in your own words. When paraphrasing, make sure to cover the same points that the speaker did. The idea is to show that you heard and understand their ideas.

Another active listening technique is to reflect the emotional context back to the speaker - for example, "I can see how passionate you are about this idea" or "I'm sensing a lot of frustration on your part." Like other active listening techniques, reflecting emotions helps us pay attention and shows the speaker that we're listening. Of course, good listening is more than just applying techniques. It means taking a genuine interest in who the speaker is and what they're saying. Using active listening techniques in the absence of curiosity can be perceived as disingenuous. By all means, paraphrase and reflect emotions, but do it from a place of honest curiosity.

How would you rate your listening skills?

6. Video: Listening When Your Emotions Are Activated (bs_acm35_a01_enus_05)

Strong emotional responses can get in the way of our listening and distort how we understand the other person's message. In this video, you'll learn about ways to listen effectively even when your emotions have been triggered.
identify ways to effectively listen when your emotions are actively engaged
[Video description begins] Topic title: Listening When Your Emotions Are Activated. [Video description ends]
HOST: Sometimes the person you're listening to says or does something that hits a nerve. Perhaps they're openly challenging your viewpoint or questioning your motives. Maybe it's inadvertent. In any case, you may get angry. Or frustrated, or stressed, or any number of emotions that tear you away from hearing their message. In other cases, it's not the message, but the messenger that's emotionally distracting. Is the person talking someone you don't get along with?

Are they intimidating somehow, perhaps because of their level of expertise or seniority? The key to good listening is to keep your attention on the person who is speaking. Therefore, you need to identify ways of listening effectively, even when you're emotionally engaged. When you're experiencing challenging emotions, your attention is on yourself and your own reactions. Your job is to keep your attention on the other person. You need to quiet the inner dialogue causing your reaction.

Here, you must rely on a mindset of curiosity. To further explore what we mean by mindset, consider this: all computers and PDAs have a core operating system, a technical environment that runs them. Think Windows, Mac OS, Android, or if you go back into the 20th century, DOS. The apps that we use on these devices function within these systems. Imagine trying to run a video streaming app on an early PC. Crash. Humans, too, have an operating system, called the brain. Its conscious operating system can be thought of metaphorically as your mindset.

Taking this a step further, consider the function of hearing sound as an app. This "auditory app" is performing in the context of the brain's operating system. The auditory app will function one way in one operating system, or mindset, and differently in another. When we change our mindset from one focusing on ourselves to one of curiosity, we change how the app processes - that is, listens to - language. Short and sweet: your mindset determines how effectively you're listening. When you're faced with emotionally challenging situations, it is even more important to tap into the curiosity mindset.

This allows your operating system to override any emotional reaction you may be having to what is being communicated and keep you from crashing. PAUL SHERMAN: Gina is the leader of a product development team at a consumer goods company, and she was faced with a difficult situation. She had a cross functional team, with members from Departments including Manufacturing, Marketing, Finance, IT, and a host of others. And unfortunately what happened was a non-listening environment had developed on the team. People in the different functions, really want hearing what another function had to say.

And infact, because of this environment emotions started running pretty high. So Gina and I sat down, and discussed how she could work with the team in the following way. She sat down with the team, and acknowledged the fact that things were difficult on the team, and everyone stood and head nodded and said yes. And what she did was she invited the team, instead of to think about themselves as different functional areas, she asked them to think about themselves as different lands, as different countries so that they were all foreign lands to each other.

Now she took this metaphor a step further, and they talked about what does being a good tourist look like when you visit a foreign land? And people discussed the fact that a good tourist ask questions, respects the local culture, tries to fit in as much as possible. And specifically, they talked about a tourist skill of curiosity. Now what's curiosity? Curiosity is really a lack of judgement. Think of it as a sense of, you know, child-like wonder. The team committed to each other that they would be tourists in one another's lands.

And began with that mindset. Sure enough what happened, listening improved the hostility actually turned into comradery. And the project got back on time and on budget. HOST: In addition to curiosity, there are other mindsets available to load onto your human operating system to help diffuse emotional situations. One such mindset is that of compassion. The speaker is a fellow human with their own strengths, weaknesses, dreams, and nightmares. How can you listen to them from a place of compassion?

What can you find to appreciate about the person speaking? How are they like you? By seeking and identifying commonalities, even with individuals we don't get along with, we can summon a compassionate mindset and focus on listening to them. And, of course, as human beings, there are situations where we can't count on our curiosity and compassion in real-time to overcome our emotions. It happens.

In these situations, the best thing you can do is take a break from the conversation to regain your composure. Take some deep breaths, relax, and give a curious, compassionate mindset another try. Clear communication and understanding are worth the effort. Think about your emotional triggers. What types of things set off negative emotional reactions in you? How do you keep them under control? How can a mindset of curiosity and compassion help you become not just a better listener, but a better colleague?
