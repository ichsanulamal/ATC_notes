2. Video: Adopting Best Practices for Listening (bs_acm37_a03_enus_02)

Listening and hearing are not the same. Hearing involves perceiving sounds passively while listening is more active and involves analyzing and understanding what you hear. To communicate successfully, it’s essential to listen effectively. In this video, you'll learn best practices for more focused and committed listening.

identify best practices for more focused and committed listening
[Video description begins] Topic title: Adopting Best Practices for Listening. [Video description ends]
Host: Have you ever sat in front of someone who was talking to you without really taking in what they'd said? Maybe you didn't listen to them or hear their words correctly. While closely intertwined, listening and hearing are not the same. Hearing involves perceiving sounds passively while listening is more active and involves analyzing and understanding what you hear. To communicate successfully, it's essential that you know how to listen effectively to the people around you.

There are best practices you can use to help you listen in a more focused, committed way. One best practice is to be purposeful with your listening. Purposeful listening is important because it keeps you informed, up to date, and helps avoid potential problems. It also makes your communication with others more meaningful and impactful, and it increases your power to negotiate. To be purposeful in your listening, you must choose to listen. Focus on what the speaker is saying rather than what you want to say in return.

Recognize that listening can help you advance and grow, so it's something you should want to do - it's not just something you should feel compelled to do. Another best practice is to give your exclusive attention to the speaker. Consider the speaker's perspective. It can be annoying when people multitask or use their phone while you're talking. Moreover, this lack of listening creates a disconnect between the speaker and the other person, damages the relationship, and likely shuts down the lines of communication.

When your attention is solely on the speaker, it's much easier to focus on hearing. Your business relationships will also benefit. Giving full attention helps you uncover meaning and value in the words of your colleagues and customers and ensures you're aware of events that may impact your organization. To give your exclusive attention to a speaker, silence your phone and keep your devices off; take notes with a pen and paper to ensure you remember what was said; and pay attention to key details.

A third best practice you can use to be an effective listener is to listen more than you talk. A conscious effort to do this can improve the quality of your listening. If you go to the office with the objective of speaking less in mind, it's easier to shift your attention towards what you hear rather than what you'd like to say. A great strategy for achieving this is to pay attention to your listen-to-talk ratio. Assess the purpose of the conversation and set out to maintain an appropriate listen-to-talk ratio; for example, you could choose a range such as 40-to-60 or 30-to-70, depending on the nature of the discussion.

The final best practice is to use whole-body listening to experience communication fully. Listen not only with your ears, but also with your eyes, mind, and heart. A person's body language can reveal clues that your ears might miss and provide insight into a speaker's feelings and intentions. So, look out for nonverbal cues, such as an expression on a customer's face when negotiating or the gestures they make in a meeting. Likewise, it's easy for a speaker to recognize how well you're listening from your body language.

To listen with your body, face fully toward the speaker with an open body posture, and don't be afraid to lean in a bit. Keep your eyes on the speaker, while being careful not to gaze or stare. And show nonverbal agreement, such as by nodding or smiling from time to time. Most speakers are encouraged when they see their audience is listening, which can help them deliver their message even better. Jennifer Nash: John and his wife were going to visit his in-laws this weekend. John told his wife that he was excited to see his in-laws. As he told his wife this, he had a grimace on his face and he wrinkled his nose. The message that John was sending with his nonverbal communication was that he really didn't want to go see his in-laws, and he wasn't excited about it.

Whole body listening is listening with more than just your ears. It's understanding that what you hear and what you see are not necessarily the same thing. To implement whole body listening, there are several things that you can do. First and foremost, you can watch to see if the words that you're hearing match the facial expressions or the body language that someone is showing you.

Second, you can tap into your intuition. What is your gut telling you about the message that someone is sending you? Does it match? Do you feel like there's something that they're not saying? So if John's wife stepped back and put together that his words did not match his facial expression She would have understood that there's a different message being sent that John really doesn't want to go see his in-laws this weekend.

Host: Think about a conversation you had at work recently that didn't go well. Maybe you misinterpreted your boss's instructions or didn't provide necessary details to a colleague. If you'd listened in a more focused way during the initial conversation, would you have gotten a different outcome - or a better result? How can you adopt these practices to become a better communicator at work?

3. Video: Developing Active Listening Skills (bs_acm37_a03_enus_03)

If you want to stand out at work and display leadership potential, it’s important to develop active listening skills. As an active listener, you can gain a reputation for being a team player that others want to work with. In this video, you'll explore methods for building active listening skills.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Developing Active Listening Skills. [Video description ends]
Host: If you want to stand out at work and display leadership potential, it's important to develop active listening skills. Active listening is an approach to listening that helps you understand the speaker's entire message and build trust with them. As an active listener, you can gain a reputation for being a team player that others want to work with. It helps you build valuable connections, and it highlights your professionalism. Jennifer Nash: If someone tells you you're not listening to me, chances are you have an opportunity to improve your active listening skills.

To actively listen, you want to be 100% present with the person who's speaking with you. One of the ways that you can actively listen to someone is you can paraphrase, or in other words, repeat what they say. So this works this way. You repeat to them what you've heard them say, and you ask them to confirm if it was correct or not. This helps them feel heard. Open-ended questions are also helpful for active listening. They demonstrate curiosity, and they help the other person feel understood. So what is an open-ended question?

An open-ended question starts with a 'W' word, most often, which could be Who, What, How, Where, When, or why? Nonverbal signals that you can look for when you're actively listening include matching someone's words with their nonverbal gestures. In other words, their facial expressions, their body language, even their tone of voice. Failure to demonstrate active listening might result in misunderstanding the person with whom you're speaking. It may also result in them not feeling heard or understood. Host: You can use various methods to help you listen actively in the workplace.

One method is to shift from hearing to listening. Instead of merely hearing sounds, actively listen to the words you hear. Analyze the content of what's being said and the attitude behind it. This can help you establish trust, develop a sense of psychological safety, and grow your influence. To shift from hearing to listening, pay attention while listening and focus on the speaker. To support your active listening, keep an open mind; withhold judgment, and be open to the speaker's ideas - even if you disagree with them. Show that you're listening through your body language: provide nonverbal cues by making eye contact or nodding as appropriate.

To listen actively, it's also important to watch for physical cues. This can help you understand the motivation and emotion behind the words spoken. For instance, if a speaker appears stressed or upset, gently asking them to tell you more can help soothe their feelings and improve the situation. When watching for physical cues, study the speaker's facial expressions, gestures, posture, and tone of voice, all of which can reveal information about their emotional state. Another method you can use to listen actively is to ask open-ended questions.

Open-ended questions draw clear, thoughtful responses. They help you get more information and understand the speaker's perspective. A good way to ask open-ended questions is to start your questions with one of the five Ws: Who, What, When, Where, and Why; for example, "What exactly do you mean by that?" Alternatively, you can ask "How" questions, such as "How should we do this?" It's also useful to ask probing questions such as, "Can you tell me more about it?" Be careful not to pry with this kind of questioning - you don't want the speaker to feel uncomfortable.

Additionally, when probing, you can pause and let the speaker fill in the blanks. To listen actively, it's also important to repeat the speaker's words. This helps the speaker feel heard, keeps the conversation on track, and gives you and the speaker time to gather your thoughts. One way to use repetition is to ask reflective, echoing, or mirroring questions that repeat a word or phrase from the speaker's statement. For example, if your coworker says, "I want a raise," you can ask, "You'd like a raise?" 

The final method you can use to listen actively is to paraphrase. Paraphrasing ensures you've listened correctly and gives the speaker an opportunity to clear up any confusing details. With paraphrasing, you put what you've heard into your own words. To paraphrase effectively, use introductory phrases like, "So, what you're saying is..." Don't jump to conclusions or state opinions; paraphrasing is about getting to the heart of the message. Think about an important conversation you had at work, whether with your boss, a teammate, or a customer.

How would active listening have influenced the result of that conversation? Being an active listener can earn you respect among those around you and make you more effective at work.

5. Video: Using Listening to Build Trust (bs_acm37_a03_enus_04)

Your credibility, likeability, and effectiveness are associated strongly with the level of trust that people believe they can share with you. Building trust takes time, and it’s grounded in effective listening. In this video, you'll learn strategies for building trust through listening.

recognize strategies to build trust through listening
[Video description begins] Topic title: Using Listening to Build Trust. [Video description ends]
Host: Trust is an essential component of success. It's the cornerstone to forming healthy relationships in every space, from work to personal life. How people perceive you is heavily impacted by how much they trust you. Your credibility, likeability, and effectiveness are associated strongly with the level of trust that people believe they can share with you. Building trust takes time, and it's grounded in effective listening. Jennifer Nash: Jesse's a new hire, and he's also an extrovert.

Jesse's about to meet his boss for the first time and he's so excited he can barely contain himself. He goes into the meeting. And he starts talking, and he doesn't stop for the entire 30 minutes. As a consequence of talking through the whole meeting, Jesse failed to receive onboarding information from his boss. Jesse leaves the meeting feeling like his boss is a great listener. However, Jesse's boss leaves the meeting feeling like Jesse has a lot of work to do in the listening space.

Jesse missed a vital opportunity to build trust by not asking his boss any questions and showing interest in his boss. That meant they could have developed their working relationship even further. Host: There are strategies you can use to build trust through listening. One strategy is to be patient. Don't rush the speaker. Doing so is disrespectful and can lead the speaker to shut down the conversation. Furthermore, the speaker may avoid talking to you in the future. Don't interrupt the speaker either.

Instead, give people a chance to tell their stories; every speaker has stories, from those about everyday occurrences to those that are an integral part of their identity. Listening to their stories can help you understand the speaker on a personal level. By listening to the speaker's experiences, you'll discover the ideas that shape their beliefs and motivations. To build trust, you should also be open to listening to uncomfortable topics. It isn't always easy, but you'll build trust more effectively when you face hard conversations head-on.

They encourage you to think about the other person's needs and wants, help you grow as an individual, and help you develop better relationships. So don't try to avoid uncomfortable conversations or become defensive when people approach you about sensitive matters. Instead, compromise, open up, and start listening. Even though talking about uncomfortable subjects can seem risky, dealing with them openly is nearly always the right thing to do. When you address problems at an early stage, it often helps you resolve the underlying issues more easily.

Try to see things from the speaker's perspective - and don't assume you're always right or have all the solutions. A third strategy you can use is to listen for the ideas beneath the words. This can help you determine the main idea being communicated and discover what the speaker really cares about. This approach can also help you understand the complete idea being expressed and not just parts of it. Listen carefully to the words the speaker uses and for the message the speaker intends to convey with each word.

As you listen, pay attention to anecdotes or explanations that can round out your understanding of each talking point, and extra details that may be relevant to the overall discussion. As you continue listening, you'll be able to link the various ideas together and get a clearer picture of what the speaker really means. Focus is key to zeroing in on the ideas and feelings that are meaningful to the speaker, so be sure to cut out any distractions, such as having your phone on. Take a moment to consider how others perceive you at work. How can you show yourself to be a credible and trustworthy colleague?

How can people know you can be counted on? By being patient and open while listening to the ideas beneath the words, you can build trust through listening and positively influence the way people perceive you.

6. Video: Working with Situational Listening Types (bs_acm37_a03_enus_05)

The kinds of messages you receive vary, depending on the context. You can adapt to changing situations by applying different listening types. In this video, you'll explore the types of listening that help you better understand the messages you receive in various situations.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Working with Situational Listening Types . [Video description ends]
Adaptability is an important skill that can help you thrive in the workplace. It's beneficial to be adaptable in your actions and also in the way you listen. That's because the kinds of messages you receive vary, depending on the context. You can adapt to changing situations by applying different listening types. Although changing the way you listen to others may be challenging, it can positively impact your communication with the people around you. There are several types of listening you can practice. One type is informational listening. It helps you learn and understand information so that you can accurately retain and apply it and perform effectively.

By using informational listening successfully, you'll be able to present yourself as a reliable asset in your workplace. Effective informational listening requires some specific actions. The first is to be prepared. Preparation mostly involves studying and reviewing any materials relevant to what you'll be hearing. Say your boss sends your team a handout in advance of a meeting. It's in your best interest to read this handout beforehand so that you're fully prepared.

Being prepared extends past doing your homework, though; proper rest and nutrition help to keep your mind sharp and shouldn't be overlooked. Effective informational listening also requires you to organize, summarize, and make connections between new and old information. This should help you analyze and evaluate the information and recognize how to use it. In addition, it's a good idea to take quality notes when listening to critical or complicated information to make it easier to remember. For effective informational listening, you can also ask questions and paraphrase.

Asking questions, especially open-ended questions, can uncover more information. Paraphrasing, which involves restating the speaker's message in your own words can help you gain trust and clarity. Another type of listening is evaluative listening. This type encourages you to think about the speaker's words from different angles. Evaluative listening sparks analytical thinking and helps you measure the credibility of a message and its speaker and then recognize the most persuasive messages.

Analysis is at the core of evaluative listening, so it can also help you solve complicated or unfamiliar problems. Imagine that you've switched departments at work, and you're faced with new challenges; a handful of coworkers offer suggestions. Evaluative listening will help you determine which pieces of advice are most helpful. This style of listening has its own set of actions that you should make habits. Be sure to research a speaker's claims, especially before basing a decision on them.

Speakers may provide their own versions of proof to back up their claims, but it's your responsibility to assess their credibility. Probe the speaker's personal observations to weigh their validity. And again, use questioning and paraphrasing to expand and confirm information. A third type of listening is empathetic listening. It helps you see things from the other person's point of view and forge closer connections. Consider this example. Your team member, Tim, didn't submit his work on time. As the team lead, this reflects poorly on you.

Tim tells you he's having some problems at home. You respond by telling him: "You'd better not miss another deadline." This lack of empathetic listening causes a breakdown in your relationship and Tim leaves the organization soon after. Empathetic listening helps you connect with the speaker by showing you identify with their issues. If you'd listened empathetically to Tim, he likely have stayed with the organization. As part of listening empathetically, provide responses that support or interpret the speaker.

Supportive responses demonstrate compassion. For example, you could say, "What's going on? I'm here to listen." Responses that interpret can give the speaker a different lens to view their situation through. For example, consider saying something like, "So, if you do manage to win back that customer, you'll probably be in line for a promotion." Additionally, questioning and paraphrasing can enhance your understanding of the speaker's point of view.

You probably have a variety of conversations each day at work, from serious interactions with management to light-hearted banter with coworkers. How do you listen in different circumstances? How can you adapt your listening style to a specific situation? Adapting to changing contexts is an important skill that will impact your communication for the better.
