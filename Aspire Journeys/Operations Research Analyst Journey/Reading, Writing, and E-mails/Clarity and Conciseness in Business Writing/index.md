# Clarity and Conciseness in Business Writing

### Business Writing Guidelines

#### 1. Use Direct Language
- Choose short, familiar words.
  - Example: "try" instead of "endeavor."
- Avoid uncommon words to maintain accessibility.
  - Example: Use "agreed" instead of "accede."
  
**Example of Simplified Writing:**
- Original: "Pursuant to the promulgation of the updated guidelines, addressees will be obligated to effect modifications to their passwords."
- Revised: "Once the guidelines are issued, you'll need to change your passwords."

#### 2. Be Concrete and Specific
- Use concrete nouns to clarify ideas.
  - Example: "CEO" is more specific than "person."
- Replace abstract nouns with concrete language.
  - Example: Specify "the broken links on the website" instead of "the problem."

#### 3. Understand Connotations
- Words have implied meanings that evoke emotional responses.
  - Choose words with the right connotation.
  - Example: Use "assertive" instead of "aggressive."

#### 4. Organize Your Writing
- Structure your document with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.
  - **Introduction:** Grab attention and state the main message.
  - **Main Body:** Present supporting information in logical paragraphs.
  - **Conclusion:** Restate key points and suggest action.

**Example of Effective Structure:**
- Introduction: "The Business Department can increase efficiency by 15% with one step—purchasing five new computers."
- Main Body: "Currently, we have five obsolete computers…"
- Conclusion: "In conclusion, approving this purchase will solve our issues immediately."

#### 5. Use Functional Words and Transition
- Use articles and prepositions to clarify meaning.
  - Avoid noun clusters for better clarity.
  - Example: Change "Department monthly budget change plan overview" to "Overview of a plan for changes to the department's monthly budget."

- Use transitional words to link ideas.
  - Examples: "However," "Therefore," "First," "Second."

#### 6. Write Concisely
- Keep sentences short (15-17 words max) and focused on one idea.
- Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases.
  - Example: Change "As of this date, we are running over budget for August" to "We are over budget for August."

#### 7. Use Precise Verbs and Active Voice
- Replace vague verbs with precise ones.
  - Example: Change "the team made slow progress" to "the team progressed slowly."
- Prefer active voice for clarity.
  - Example: "Lois drives the truck" instead of "The driver of the truck is Lois."

#### 8. Enhance Readability with Design Elements
- Use white space effectively to reduce text density.
- Incorporate graphics to support your message.
- Use short lines of text and ragged right margins for ease of reading.
- Utilize bulleted lists for clarity.
- Break up longer documents with headings for easier navigation.

By following these guidelines, you can improve the clarity and effectiveness of your business writing.
