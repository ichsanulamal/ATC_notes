identify examples of guidelines for making clear word choices when writing
[Topic title: Choosing Words: Simple, Concrete, and Appropriate.] So much business communication is done in writing, which means that to make yourself understood, you need to write clearly. Words are the building blocks of good writing, and you can make sure you choose the best ones, by following a few guidelines.

First of all, business writing needs to be direct. So use short familiar words that are easy to understand. When you have a choice between a long word and a short one, use the word with fewer syllables. Like roughly, instead of approximately and try instead of endeavor. These short words are easier to read, and have more impact too. Using familiar words that your readers will likely know, makes your writing accessible. So, accede could be replaced with agreed, and enumerate with count. If you use too many uncommon words, your writing maybe harder to understand, and sound pompous or pretentious.

For example, what do you think of this sentence? Pursuant to the promulgation of the updated guidelines, addressees will be obligated to effect modifications to their passwords. You probably think it sounds silly. Being formal or respectful, doesn't have to mean being wordy. And simpler vocabulary, gets your message across more effectively. That earlier tongue twister could be much better written as. Once the guidelines are issued, you'll need to change your passwords.

And to be as concrete and specific as possible. Concrete nouns refer to, or name, particular things, ideas, or actions. They vary in how specific they are. For example, person is a concrete noun, but it's very broad. Whereas CEO is more specific, because it describes the person's role. Even more specific would be the CEO's name.

Abstract nouns, describe things that aren't so easy to visualize or sense. They often refer to qualities and ideas, like a management, culture or freedom. Whenever you can, replace abstract word with more concrete language. So, if you're e-mailing a team member about a problem with broken web links, instead of writing, remember, that problem needs to be resolved soon. Specify exactly what the problem is. The broken links on the website. And instead of asking them to fix it soon, give them a specific time. Say by the end of this week.

Besides it's literal meaning, a word can have an implied meaning known as a connotation. A word's connotation is an idea or an emotional response the word invokes, and it can be negative or positive. So, in your writing use words with appropriate connotations, for the meaning you're trying to convey. For example, in a positive review for a competent staff member, describe her as assertive rather than aggressive. And say she is firm, rather than stubborn. If you're not sure of a word's connotation, refer to a dictionary or a word usage guide.

Choosing words that are concrete and simple, will help you send a clear message, and reduce the risk of misunderstanding.

[Topic title: Choosing Words: Nouns, Modifiers, and Transitions.] Every word you write has a job to do. Even the word as seemingly insignificant as the article the. Your job is to use different kinds of words to convey your meaning as clearly and concisely as possible. Some words are functional words. Articles like the and a and prepositions like by, for, and from. Use these words to revise noun clusters which can make your meaning unclear.

Nouns are words that describe people, places, or things, and noun clusters are groups of nouns stacked on top of each other, without a functional word to separate them, like this one. [A sample noun cluster displays.]

Department monthly budget change plan overview. It might take your reader a while to figure out what that means. But if you revise it to, overview of a plan for changes to the department's monthly budget, the meaning becomes clearer.

Another tip, use adjectives and adverbs sparingly. Strong nouns and verbs are the framework of well-written sentences. Words that modify nouns and verbs are called adjectives and adverbs. But too many of them can make your sentence hard to follow. Take this sentence. The report's final conclusion is that the company needs to responsively address employees' concerned statements. The modifiers final, responsively, and concerned aren't necessary, are they? For one thing, a conclusion by definition is final. Responsively addressed could be more simply written as respond. And concerned statements could just be concerns.

By using stronger nouns or verbs, you can make your point more concisely and with more impact as in, the report concludes that the company needs to respond to employee concerns. You don't have to throw out all adjectives and adverbs. They can provide necessary detail to make your meaning clear.

Adjectives clarify nouns by answering questions like what kind, which, or how many? So in the sentence, the marketing report is finished. Marketing modifies the noun report, to show which one you're talking about. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs, answering the question how, why, when, or where? As in, he finished the marketing report yesterday.

Another tip to make your writing clear is to use appropriate transitional words or phrases. These show how the ideas in your writing are linked. For example, words like but and however, tell your reader that you're moving from one idea to a contrasting one. Words like therefore, indicate that you're moving from an explanation into a conclusion. Other transitional words indicate place or direction like beside or above, or show time and sequence like first or second.

These are just some of the uses of transitional words, but all of them improve the flow of your writing by connecting your sentences fluidly. A strategically placed transition word, functional word, adjective, or adverb can make your writing clearer. Consider which type of word can best express your meaning, and choose your words wisely.

[Topic title: Writing Concisely: Keeping it Short and to the Point.] In business writing, it's especially important to be concise. Imagine if a colleague called you up and took ten minutes to get to the point of their call. You'd be annoyed they wasted your time, wouldn't you? It's the same in business writing. Being concise doesn't only mean being brief though. Brevity is about the quantity of words you use, but conciseness is about the quality. Writing concisely means eliminating anything that doesn't add to the meaning of your text. You can achieve this in a few ways.

First of all, write short sentences. You risk losing your readers attention when you use too many words, instead you should a maximum of 15 to 17 words per sentence. Any longer and your reader may miss vital information or have to read the same thing twice. Be brief and to the point and they'll get it right away.

The best way to keep your sentences short is to include just one idea in every sentence. Let's examine the suggestion from a manager to her team. We should involve Marketing, who incidentally have been quite successful in their latest campaign to sell more textbooks, in the development of this new product. The manager's first idea, to involve Marketing in development, gets lost in a second idea, that Marketing has been quite successful in their latest campaign. Breaking the sentence into two ideas makes the message clearer, as in, we should involve Marketing in the development of this new product. They have been quite successful in their latest campaign to sell more textbooks.

Another good way to write concisely is to avoid unnecessary words. Some words just clutter your sentences without adding meaning. Which words would you take out of this example? We're as of this date running over budget for August. On the other hand, we're on target to meet the deadline. Well to start with, long prepositional phrases, such as as of this date or with regard to, can often be replaced with shorter words, or eliminated altogether. Long winded conjunctions, too, can often be cut and replaced with something more succinct. For example, on the other hand can be replaced with but or and.

Try to avoid unnecessary repetition, [The following sentence displays: It's extremely urgent that we cooperate together.] where you use more than one word that means the same thing such as cooperate together. And don't add unnecessary modifiers. Like saying something is extremely urgent. The word urgent indicates immediate attention or action as needed, so there's no need to amplify its meaning.

You can also do without unnecessary sentence starters that lead into the meaning of your text. [The following example displays: Please be advised that the majority of employees agree.] Phrases like, please be advised that or it was found that, in general, don't write multiple words when one will do. So instead of saying the majority of employees just say most employees.

The trick to being concise is to identify exactly what you want to communicate to your readers. Hold on to the main point. Avoid clutter. And you'll get your message across in the most effective way possible.

In this video, you will learn how to recognize the effective use of precise verbs and active voice in a given sample of business writing.
recognize the effective use of precise verbs and active voice in a given sample of business writing
[Topic title: Writing Concisely: Using the Right Verbs and Voice.] Verbs convey action. If you want to make your business writing concise and to the point, you need to pay attention to the verbs you use.

One way to be more concise, is to replace vague verbs with precise verbs. That can help you eliminate unnecessary words and add impact. Consider this sentence, the team made slow progress, and resource costs were beginning to rise. You can replace made slow progress with the more concise, progressed slowly. The words were beginning to rise can be replace by a single word, rose.

Forms of the verb to be such as am, is, are, was, and were, are among the most commonly used vague verbs. It's usually easy to replace them with more precise verbs. For example, instead of saying Lois is the driver of the truck. You could say, Lois drives the truck.

Verbs that don't signify a precise action are often used in a vague way with other words needed to make the meaning clear. Some common offenders are do and perform and the sentence, our department does investigations of customer complaints. The verb does needs the noun investigations to clarify the meaning. But you can replace the verb noun combination with a precise verb, investigates.

Even verbs that clearly signify an action can often be improved. For example, when you say, the boss looked at my proposal, could you be more precise. How about the boss glanced at my proposal or the boss scrutinized my proposal. Both of those precise verbs mean look but with a very different result for your proposal.

Consider using the active voice to make your writing succinct and energetic. In the active voice, a sentence has a subject, a verb, and an object in that order, and the subject performs the action. So in the sentence, the buyer signed the contract, the subject is the buyer who performs the action signed on the object, the contract.

The passive voice reverses that order. So the buyer signed the contract becomes the contract was signed by the buyer. Now the subject is the contract, which is acted upon by the verb, was signed. Sometimes, the subject is left out entirely, as in, the contract was signed.

In business writing, it's usually best to stick with the active voice. It's less wordy, easier to read and more precise. However, the passive voice can be useful when the action itself is more important than who performed it. So if you were describing the completion of a long delayed construction project you might say, eventually, the skyscraper was completed. Instead of, eventually, the builders completed the skyscraper. But unless you have a good reason for using the passive voice, use the active voice.

Using precise verbs in the active voice can help you get your message across in fewer words with greater impact. Your readers will tune in, instead of tuning out.

recognize ways of organizing written text for greater reader understanding
[Topic title: Organizing Content: Giving Purpose to Your Writing.] Your writing has to be well organized if it's to get your message across. For that, you need a few key elements, a good introduction, a well-structured main body, and a punchy conclusion.

Your introduction should grab the reader's attention. Start with a hook that encourages the reader to continue reading, maybe a question or an interesting fact. Your introduction should also state your key message and briefly explain the purpose of your document.

Suppose a department manager is writing to convince her boss to approve the purchase of new computers. She starts with the sentence. The Business Department can increase its efficiency an estimated 15%, if we take one step - purchasing five new computers. That's a great hook. She's grabbed attention by promising 15% more efficiency with just one step. And she's also said exactly what she wants, five new computers. She sets up her key reasoning in her second sentence. Faster, new computers will significantly speed up ordering and bill processing. And she explains her purpose in her final sentence. After reading this report, I hope that you will approve the purchase of the faster, new computers.

After the introduction comes the main body, the longest part of your document. It should include all the information you need to support your main idea as outlined in your introduction. If it's longer than a few sentences, divide it into paragraphs. Each paragraph should contain a single idea that follows on logically from the paragraph before. A good paragraph opens with a topic sentence, stating your core point. Then, you expand on that in the sentences that follow.

So the Department Manager starts her first main body paragraph with the sentence, currently, we have five obsolete computers in the business office. Then she provides information to back up that point. In the past year, at least one computer has crashed each month, requiring my employees to seek help from the IT department. You can organize your main body in a few ways, in chronological order, into advantages and disadvantages, according to level of importance, or into categories.

When you've finished making your case, sum things up in a strong conclusion. You can restate the message or discuss the implications of your main point. Or, you might ask the reader to take action.

In her conclusion, the Department Manager restates her message. In conclusion, the issues we're facing are severely hindering the work of the department - and by extension, of the company. She then describes the implications and gives the reader a quick solution in her final sentence. Approving the requested purchase will solve the problem immediately, and we can all get back to doing what we do best: making a valuable contribution to the work of this organization.

Structure is a key aspect of good business writing. It's a map for your readers, pointing them to your purpose.

identify design elements that can help increase reader understanding of written text
[Topic title: Organizing Content: Using Design Elements.] You've written your business document. It's concise and well expressed. And you're certain it will get a great reception. But when you go to your boss for feedback, she just looks at you in puzzlement. You know your writing was clear. But there's something you've forgotten. You formatted everything as a single block of tiny text. You can be as clear as crystal, but if your writing isn't formatted and presented correctly, all that clarity will go to waste. Your reader will find it frustratingly hard to read. A few simple design tricks may help you avoid this situation.

First of all, use white space to give your reader space to breathe. White space makes text less dense and easier to digest. One good way to use white space is to include a large enough margin between your text and the edges of the page. One inch is a good rule of thumb.

Next, you've heard it said that a picture tells a 1,000 words. Well, you can take advantage of that by using graphics. Sometimes, a well-placed graphic can put your message across even better than the text alone. A good chart can demonstrate your sale success even better than the raw figures can. But be sparing. Adding unnecessary graphics can take away from your message.

When every line is the same length, your text can look like a daunting block. So it's a good idea to include some short lines of text. Instead of justifying both left and right margins, leave a ragged right margin. Visually, that makes it easier for the reader to remember where they are on the page, which makes it easier to read quickly.

You can use bulleted list to present logically related points clearly and concisely. When you're trying to explain steps in a process, for example, it can be much easier to digest a list than a paragraph. And the visual difference between a bulleted list and the surrounding paragraphs can break up the text for the reader and help them to focus. Don't overuse lists though, keep them for when they really help get your point across.

Finally, break up longer documents with headings. They make your structure clear for the reader and easier to navigate. Headings can help show logical breaks between thoughts, so add them where they're needed. And to make sure to differentiate your headings from surrounding text using a different font or font size. If your text looks great, your readers will appreciate your message, before they even read a word.

"She should be glad we've been so economical."
Feedback:
Option 1:
This is a correct option. "Conduct an appraisal" is a complex phrase that can be replaced by the simpler "check."
Option 2:
This is a correct option. Instead of using the vague word "manager," it's good to use more concrete language.
Option 3:
This is a correct option. "Economical" has more appropriate connotations than "stingy."
Option 4:
This is an incorrect option. "Elated" and "parsimonious" are complex words that could be replaced by simpler ones.
Option 5:
This is an incorrect option. It's better to be specific about the exact time
Question 2: Multiple Choice
Consider this sentence: "Managers and employees need to cooperatively work together to reach a consensus of opinion."

Which revision correctly applies a technique for clearer writing?

Options:
1.
"Managers and employees moreover need to cooperatively work together."

3.
"Managers and employees need to cooperatively work together to reach an opinion consensus."
Answer
2.
"Managers and employees need to cooperate to reach a consensus."
Feedback:
Option 1:
This is an incorrect option. Transition words like "moreover" can make your sentence clearer, but not in this case.
Option 2:
This is the correct option. By eliminating the unnecessary adverbs and adjectives, this revision makes the sentence clearer.
Option 3:
This is an incorrect option. In the phrase "opinion consensus," the word "opinion" is redundant.
Question 3: Multiple Choice
Consider this sentence: "It has come to our attention that we should involve the design team, who have experience that could benefit the newest most recent assignment and future environmental marketing campaigns, in the image research."

What changes can be made to this sentence to make it more concise?

Feedback:
Option 1:
This is a correct option. There's no need to use both "most recent" and "newest" – they mean the same thing.
Option 2:
This is an incorrect option. The adjective "environmental" adds meaning to the sentence, so it's better not to remove it.
Option 3:
This is an incorrect option. You could choose either word, but neither makes the sentence any more concise than the other.
Option 4:
This is a correct option. The sentence includes two ideas: one about involving the design team in research, and the other about the design team's experience.

This is an incorrect option. The sentence is in the passive voice – it begins by identifying the object.
Option 4:
This is a correct option. The sentence is written in the active voice and includes the precise verbs "instructed" and "study."

Make sure all content in the body of the document supports your main idea and follows a logical structure
2.
Provide closure by restating your main idea, discussing its implications, or requesting action
3.
At the start of your document, include content that gains the attention of the reader and introduces your main idea and purpose
Feedback:
Option 1:
This is a correct option. The main body should contain information to support the message you've outlined in your introduction, and it should be organized in a logical way.
Option 2:
This is a correct option. Your conclusion should draw readers back to the main purpose of your message
Option 3:
This is a correct option. A good introduction grabs your readers' attention, identifies your main message, and makes your purpose clear.
Option 4:
This is an incorrect option. Paragraphs make your text easier to understand, but you should construct paragraphs around a single idea, not add them arbitrarily based on length.

Some short lines of text
6.
White space
Answer
1.
Bulleted lists
2.
Appropriate graphics
5.
Some short lines of text
6.
White space
Feedback:
Option 1:
This is a correct option. It can be easier to digest a list than a paragraph, so consider using bulleted lists.
Option 2:
This is a correct option. Don't overuse graphics, but a well-placed image can help get your message across.
Option 3:
This is an incorrect option. It's a better idea to leave a ragged right margin, so that your text does not appear as a single block.
Option 4:
This is an incorrect option. You should include headings, but add them where they're needed, not by rote.
Option 5:
This is a correct option. If every line is the same length, your text can be harder to read.
Option 6:
This is a correct option. White space makes your text less dense, which makes it easier to read.
