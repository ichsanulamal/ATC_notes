# Writing Effective E-mails and Instant Messages

Here’s a concise summary of key points from the videos on email and instant messaging etiquette:

### Email Etiquette Overview

1. **Tone Matters**: 
   - Be mindful of how your words might be interpreted. Use questions rather than commands to soften your tone.
   - Example: Instead of "Get the report to me by 5 PM," try "Could you please send the report by 5 PM? I’d really appreciate it."

2. **Know Your Audience**:
   - Tailor your language and formality based on your relationship with the recipient.
   - Use formal language for first-time communications; reserve emoticons for informal messages.

3. **Formatting**:
   - Avoid using all caps (it can seem like shouting) and aggressive formatting (like excessive bold or underline).
   - Stick to plain text for a professional appearance.

4. **Composition**:
   - Structure your email logically. Use clear, concise sentences and proper grammar.
   - Break up text into bullet points or numbered lists to improve readability.

5. **Prompt Responses**:
   - Aim to reply to emails within 24 hours to prevent delays and frustration.
   - Ensure your responses address all questions posed.

6. **Add a Signature**:
   - Include your full contact details in your email signature for professionalism and ease of contact.

7. **Proofread**:
   - Always check your emails for errors before sending to maintain professionalism.

### Email Components

- **From Field**: Use your full name for clarity and professionalism.
- **Subject Line**: Craft clear, concise subject lines (5-7 words) that reflect the content.
- **Greeting**: Match the formality of your greeting to your relationship with the recipient.
- **Message Body**: Clearly communicate your main point and support it with relevant information.
- **Closing**: Use polite sign-offs to soften your message and indicate it's complete.

### Conciseness in Emails

- Focus on one main point per email. If multiple topics arise, consider separate emails.
- Get to the point quickly and avoid unnecessary details.
- Use bullet points to highlight key information.
- Keep emails short enough to fit in the preview pane.
- Avoid large attachments; compress files if necessary.

### Instant Messaging Etiquette

1. **Respect Availability**: Only message when contacts are available; don’t interrupt if they’re busy.
2. **Start with a Greeting**: Acknowledge the person you're messaging to make it more personal.
3. **Complete Messages**: Send full thoughts in one message to avoid confusion.
4. **Log Off When Away**: Don't leave your status as available if you're not at your computer to avoid seeming rude.

Following these guidelines will help ensure effective and respectful communication in both emails and instant messaging.
