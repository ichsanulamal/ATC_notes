# Sending E-mails to the Right People

Sure! Here's a summary of the key points from your e-mail communication guidelines:

### 1. **Pre-Addressing Emails**
   - Avoid entering recipients in the "To" field until your message is written and reviewed.
   - Deleting the original recipient when replying helps prevent accidental sends.

### 2. **Direct Recipients**
   - Only include individuals who need to act on your message in the "To" field.
   - Too many recipients can lead to confusion about responsibility, so be selective.

### 3. **Cc and Bcc Usage**
   - **Cc (Carbon Copy)**: Use sparingly to keep others informed without needing a response.
   - **Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy)**: Use to protect privacy when sending to multiple recipients without revealing their addresses.
   - Avoid copying over someone’s head unless absolutely necessary.

### 4. **Setting Email Priority**
   - Use high priority for urgent messages and low priority for non-urgent communications.
   - Don’t misuse priority flags to ensure your important messages stand out.

### 5. **Replying to Emails**
   - Edit recipients in "Cc" when replying and update the subject line for clarity.
   - Include the original email thread to maintain context.
   - Avoid using "Reply All" unless everyone needs to see your response, especially if you were Bcc’d.

### 6. **Forwarding Emails**
   - Always seek permission before forwarding someone’s email.
   - Explain the relevance of the forwarded email to the new recipients.
   - Protect privacy by deleting previous recipient addresses and avoiding mass forwarding.

### 7. **Poor Copying Practices**
   - Don’t copy over someone’s head to manipulate or embarrass them.
   - Only copy others to keep them informed, not to escalate issues improperly.
   - Address conflicts directly rather than using email as a weapon.

These best practices can help ensure your email communications are professional, clear, and respectful.
