identify tips for using the To field when sending e-mail
[Topic title: Using the To Field.] It's hard to imagine a working day that doesn't involve e-mail. Even holidays and sick days often require you to check your inbox, to make sure you haven't missed something crucial. There are downsides, however, to people's reliance on this medium.

E-mail's speed and ease of use mean that messages are often composed quickly and delivered after very little reflection. But the content of your e-mails, and crucially, the recipients you include, require planning and thought. If you want to be taken seriously at work, you have to take how you communicate seriously too. Let's look at a few problems first. In particular, those that can arise when you pre-address e-mails, don't include direct recipients in the To field, or include too many recipients in the To field.

The problem with pre-addressing your e-mails is that it makes it too easy to send an inappropriate or unprofessional message, which could have lasting consequences. It seems obvious to say, but you should always review an e-mail message carefully before sending it. Many people don't do this. They're all pushed for time. However, this final review can save you from having to spend time trying to patch up a broken relationship caused by a hasty reply. So don't enter a recipient in the To field until you've written and reviewed your e-mail. If you're replying to a message from someone else, delete the recipient from the To field before composing your response to eliminate the possibility of accidentally sending an incomplete or rash message.

Business messages are often relevant to more than one recipient. Direct recipients are individuals who have to act on your message or reply directly. Put their addresses into the To field of your e-mail. Suppose you've completed an order for a new server on behalf of your company. You want to confirm the order in an e-mail to Rob, the head of procurements, so you put his address in the To field. You also believe that it's necessary to inform Matt in IT of the confirmation, as he'll be the person installing the server when it arrives. You add Matt to the To field.

Ever receive an e-mail where it's unclear who should take action because everyone is in the To field? This is a common problem. The solution? Don't include too many direct recipients in the To field. If you overdo the number of direct recipients, they may not take responsibility for replying to the e-mail, because each may think that someone else will respond. There's also a risk that each recipient may wait to see how others respond before replying. With the result that nobody responds, or everyone weighs in behind the most influential personality.

Make sure your direct recipients are people who are directly involved, who understand what their role is in relation to your message. You'll be more clear about what you're asking for in your e-mail messages if you're clear about who needs to be included in the To field.

3. Video: Using the Cc and Bcc Fields (bs_acm02_a02_enus_02)

In this video, you will learn how to use the Cc and Bcc fields appropriately in an email.
Objectives
use the Cc and Bcc fields appropriately in an e-mail
[Topic title: Using the Cc and Bcc Fields.] The Cc, or carbon copy address field, and the Bcc, or blind carbon copy address field, are useful e-mail features, but are often misused. You can create a nuisance by Cc'ing people unnecessarily. Cause offense by Cc'ing over the head of someone. Or even generate scandal by confusing the Cc and Bcc fields, and revealing addresses you'd intended to keep secret. Let's consider basic etiquette rules in relation to these fields.

First, use the Cc field to copy someone from whom you don't require a direct response. Be aware that any addresses you add to this field can be read by other recipients. Use the Cc field sparingly. Always ask yourself, why you're copying someone. Is it really important to copy this person, or are you just adding unnecessarily to the list of e-mails they will have to read? Too much copying confuses recipients, jams up their e-mail inboxes, and wastes people's time. And if you overuse the Cc field, your e-mails may end up being ignored.

One good reason to use the Cc field, is to keep the recipient visibly in the loop regarding discussions. And maybe, for example, that your company has processes that demand this type of visibility. Another good reason for using Cc field is FYIing, to keep people informed, enabling them to track discussions and monitor situations without being directly involved. Also, don't use the Cc field to copy over someone's head.

Say you're not happy with the role your manager has assigned you on a project. You write him an e-mail, making this point. But then you include his manager in the Cc field. You have just escalated the situation before your boss has even had a chance to respond to your complaint. What about Bcc? When do you use this field? Use it when you want to include recipients in an e-mail without disclosing them to direct or Cc recipients, thereby protecting the address and privacy of the party and the Bcc field.

Suppose you're an HR manager informed a candidate for an upcoming interview. You may include the panel interviewers in the Bcc field. You want the interviewers to know the applicant has been informed of the date, time, and place for the interview. But you don't want the applicant to know who will be conducting the interview or what their addresses are.

Before using the Bcc field, ask yourself why you need to copy anyone secretly. Think about your motives and make sure your intentions are respectable. People often consider their e-mails private, even when they don't say so explicitly. If you really have a good reason to copy someone on a message, consider using the Cc field or e-mailing other recipients separately. Following this guidance on using the Cc and Bcc fields correctly can help you avoid some of the worst problems that result from e-mail communications.

4. Video: Flagging E-mails (bs_acm02_a02_enus_03)

During this video, you will learn how to set the priority status of emails appropriately.
Objectives
set the priority status of e-mails appropriately
[Topic title: Flagging E-mails.] All of your e-mail messages are important. But some may be more important than others. Indicating the priority status of an e-mail [such as High Importance or Low Importance] can help you communicate better. Most e-mail systems allow you to set the message priority when you compose a message.

How you set the status of an e-mail decides the priority flag it receives in the recipient's inbox. E-mails automatically receive normal priority when they are created. When you give an important e-mail a high priority flag, however, that e-mail will stand out and be noticed. You can also set a low priority flag for e-mails that are unimportant or that don't demand a reply. Priority settings can be important when your message requires someone's attention urgently, or alternatively, when you feel the recipient shouldn't divert themselves from other priorities to look at your e-mail. Let's examine best practice for using these settings.

Don't overuse high priority flagging. High priority is only useful for urgent e-mails that may demand immediate action. Using this flag helps to get your e-mail noticed and read in a business environment where people deal with many e-mails daily. But don't cry wolf and misuse the high priority flag for a message of normal or low priority just to get a quick reply. If you're seen as someone who regularly overstates the priority of your messages, you may not be able to get someone to read your e-mail when the message is genuinely urgent.

The low priority flag can be used for sending an e-mail that isn't urgent, or is casual. Use it for a when you can get around to it kind of e-mail. Or for issues not directly related to work. Imagine you want to send three e-mails. The first, to a colleague, has the subject line Team building ideas for next year. The second e-mail is an urgent schedule change request. And the third, to a security company requesting a quote for a conference that is due to take place in six months' time. How would you set the priority status for each message? Due to its urgency, you might set the status e-mail requesting a schedule change to high priority to ensure that it's addressed immediately.

The team-building e-mail is not as important and is more exploratory than urgent. So you give it a low priority flag to let your colleague know that it doesn't require attention or a response, and can be read at any time. Finally, because the request for a quote is not urgent, you leave the status setting on this e-mail as normal priority. Recipients can see that the message is neither very urgent nor casual and unimportant. And that they are free to reply at their convenience. Setting the priority of all your e-mail messages appropriately will help ensure you get the responses you require when you need them.

5. Video: Targeting E-mail Replies (bs_acm02_a02_enus_04)

In this video, find out how to recognize when to reply effectively to e-mails.
Objectives
recognize how to reply effectively to e-mails
[Topic title: Targeting E-mail Replies.] Suppose your manager is looking for your private opinion on a performance report she's sending to an employee. She includes you in the Bcc field of her e-mail. You compose your response but, without thinking, hit Reply to all. The employee gets to see your opinion. But also the fact that you were secretly copied on the manager's original mail.

Who you send e-mail messages to is important because it can affect, and sometimes disrupt, work and business relationships. Consider some best practices for using Reply and Reply to All. You've probably been at the receiving end of e-mails from annoyed colleagues asking why you've included them or didn't include them on a particular e-mail. Nobody wants to have to take the time to figure out if the message is directly relevant to them. Always edit the addresses in the Cc field, so that you copy only people who require the information you include in your response.

When replying, update the subject line of your e-mail to reflect the content of your response. Updating the subject line will make it easy for recipients to identify what your message is about, and to find it in their inboxes. Reusing the same subject line repeatedly can mean recipients confuse your response with previous e-mails with the same subject lines. The recipient may have to open lots of messages to find yours.

Always include the original thread of the e-mail below your response. The thread is a record of all the communication that has occurred before your current response. It covers the original message and any previous replies. By default, the thread appears below your new reply. Don't delete the thread or compose a completely new e-mail message to respond. If there's no thread, recipients may have to search for and read other e-mails to figure out what you're referring to.

Choosing the Reply to All option means that your response to an e-mail will automatically be addressed to all recipients of the original message. Reply to All is a powerful feature, but it's often used incorrectly, roping a bunch of people into a response that just isn't relevant to them. Best practice for replying to all is to avoid overusing it. Use it only if everyone included in the To and Cc fields needs to read the response. And if you've been included in the Bcc field of an e-mail, avoid using Reply To All. The last thing you want is to reveal your identity, and the fact that you were secretly copied.

Using reply to all to send personal messages of thanks or agreement isn't a good idea. Instead, send thank you and me too replies to the direct recipient. Following these best practices in your e-mail replies will make your communications more effective.

6. Video: Forwarding E-mails (bs_acm02_a02_enus_05)

Learn how to identify best practices for forwarding email.
Objectives
identify best practices for forwarding e-mail
[Topic title: Forwarding E-mails.] Forwarding e-mails is a fast way to pass on information to others, but it can create problems if used incorrectly. For example, if the e-mail you forward isn't of use to the people you send it to, you are adding needlessly to the stack of e-mails they have to get through. If it includes content that may offend, forwarding it could upset recipients and damage your organization's reputation. Let's consider guidelines for forwarding e-mails.

As a general first step, always ask the author of an e-mail if you may forward it to others. With all the communications traffic in a workplace today, some people lose sight of the fact that business e-mail is confidential. Forwarding a message carelessly can violate the privacy of your company and your colleagues. It can also reveal private information like company e-mail addresses to people who shouldn't have access to them. Before forwarding an e-mail, ask yourself, why am I forwarding this information? If the information isn't relevant to the recipient's work, don't forward it.

There are certain kinds of e-mail you should never forward, including Internet mass marketing e-mails, also known as spam. Look out for chain-letter e-mails which usually promise rewards if you forward them or terrible consequences if you don't. When you forward an e-mail, some e-mail applications add forwarding symbols such as right-pointing arrows at the start of each line of the original message. Always delete these forwarding symbols and other forwarding headers from your message before forwarding it as they make an e-mail confusing for recipients. An e-mail that you have cleaned up is more likely to be taken seriously.

Do you ever receive a forwarded e-mail and find yourself puzzled about its relevance to you? It's always a good idea to explain why you think the e-mail you're forwarding is relevant to the recipient. Add a personal comment or greeting above the message. How do you respond when you're one among dozens of people targeted by an e-mail? Probably slowly and indifferently, if at all. Avoid forwarding messages to many recipients at once, because you can't include a personal comment explaining the relevance of the message to each recipient.

When you forward an e-mail to other people, the addresses of previous recipients display by default in the message pane immediately above the original message. Delete these addresses before forwarding the e-mail to protect their privacy. If you have to forward an e-mail to different recipients who don't know one another, add all the recipients' addresses to the Bcc field. This ensures you don't reveal the recipients' addresses. Add your own address to the To field so that you can send the e-mail. Applying these best practices demonstrates respect for the people you communicate with and can help ensure your message is professional and easy to follow.

7. Video: Poor Copying Practices (bs_acm02_a02_enus_06)

In this video, you will learn how to recognize examples of when it's inappropriate to copy an e-mail behind someone's back.
Objectives
recognize examples of when it's inappropriate to copy an e-mail over someone's head
[Topic title: Poor Copying Practices.] You're unhappy with a colleague's response to a proposal you made, so you e-mail him again, this time copying his manager and the CEO. You may feel you had no alternative, but by copying over someone's head you've just engaged in a form of manipulation. This approach may achieve results but it won't win you any friends. You will come off as self-serving and may turn a simple situation into a nasty personal attack.

Before you copy people on e-mails ask yourself why you're copying them. The only good reason to copy someone is to keep them visibly informed. So what are inappropriate motives for copying a message over someone's head? Consider these examples.

A colleague, Stephen, says something that embarrasses you in a meeting with a client. Back at your desk, you fire off an angry e-mail to Stephen and copy the message to your manager. You're clearly acting from the wrong motive, copying over your colleague's head just because you're angry. Some people may copy over someone's head in order to promote themselves or make themselves look good. An example might be copying a manager on e-mails sent outside work hours to highlight that you're working overtime. If it's truly important information, tell your manager directly. It's clearly inappropriate to try to manipulate someone into doing what you want by revealing your intentions to other recipients.

Let's say you e-mail a colleague with an informal request to prioritize work on your project over another. Don't copy your manager in this case. You'd be using your manager's seniority to manipulate your colleague into agreeing. Suppose you need to e-mail a member of your team about their poor performance. The only likely reason you'd copy their colleagues is to humiliate them. Don't engage in this kind of unprofessional and unethical behavior, designed to embarrass. Nor do you want to engage in duplicating. This occurs when you copy a superior, such as a manager, as additional proof of an issue that's already been documented.

Duplication is something you might try if you're looking to escalate an issue to get a result. For example, by re-sending an e-mail to a colleague who hasn't answered your queries but including your manager on the duplicated e-mail. Sometimes, more than one motive is at play. For instance, someone sends you an e-mail and copies other managers in an attempt to humiliate you and manipulate you into agreeing to a proposal.

There are exceptions when you may copy over someone's head, such as when you're praising rather than criticizing, when you have the main recipient's permission to copy, or when it's demanded by a formalized work process. In general, however, if you have an issue with someone, speak to this person directly rather than using e-mail and copying superiors. It can take courage to deal with an issue face-to-face, but it's more professional and effective. Keep these guidelines in mind when you're considering copying over somebody's head.

•	Job Aid: Addressing and Flagging Best Practices
Use this job aid to review e-mail addressing and flagging best practices.
Addressing e-mails

Using the address fields appropriately will help ensure that you send e-mails only to the people who need them, and that recipients understand why you've mailed them.

You use the To field

when you're sending a message directly to one or more people, and the names must be visible to all recipients
you expect a direct response from the recipient
You use the Cc field

when it's really necessary and important for one or more recipients to receive copies of an e-mail you send
when it will be clear to recipients why you've chosen to copy them
when someone must be kept visibly in the loop of a discussion
when someone requires the information in an e-mail but doesn't need to respond to it directly
You use the Bcc field

only when it's necessary to protect the privacy of recipients' addresses and identities, but when it's important they receive copies of an e-mail you send
when your motives for using the Bcc field are appropriate
Flagging e-mails
