Professional writing is how we communicate business information. It involves conveying important information to the reader using clear and concise language. In this video, you'll explore the essential aspects necessary for crafting professional communication.

Professional writing is how we communicate business information. It involves conveying important information to the reader using clear and concise language. It could be through reports, emails, memos, notices, proposals, presentations, or websites. Professional communication differs from personal conversations, which are informal exchanges between individuals. The ability to craft professional messages is crucial for business success. So, being clear and concise is one of the most important elements of professional writing. I actually had a client who was a program manager and she was in the area of compliance so it was very important to her to make sure that she had a great amount of detail in all of the messages she was communicating to executives.

The challenge was because they were long and detailed and complicated, she couldn't get the action she needed from the executives. So, what would more often than not happen is they would delete the messages or they wouldn't read them. People don't have a lot of time in the workplace today. Executives especially don't have a lot of time. They're very time-constrained. So, if they see a long email, they may not read it. They just literally don't have the time. So, we work together to develop a methodology whereby she would have the executives take action on the emails and this is the process that we followed. Number 1, I had her clearly state the purpose of the message and put the call to action in the subject line of the email. The next thing that I had her do was identify the three most important points to highlight within the email for communication to the executive and then to include the call to action.

So, what exactly did she want them to do? And then she put all of the detail in the backup. So, she had the detail that she was very sort of wedded to in the email but she had all of the important information upfront. Executives started reading her messages. They started responding. And in this way, she was able to really move the business forward. And that worked very effectively for her. Let's look at the essential aspects necessary for crafting effective professional communication. The purpose of the message is the most essential aspect of professional communication. Your writing must reflect exactly what you want to convey.

To identify the purpose of your message, start with some basic questions. Most importantly, ask yourself what you're trying to achieve with your message. Why are you sending it? Are you informing, persuading, or making a request? Think about what you want the reader to do after they read your message. Based on your answers, your purpose could be to share information, make a request, or persuade the reader to take some action. Sharing information might include explaining how things work, how to get tasks done, or how to solve problems. For instance, memos, user manuals, and product specifications provide directions. This type of writing also provides data to help make decisions like minutes of a meeting, reports, or financial statements. Alternatively, your purpose might be to make a request asking the reader for specific information.

This occurs in daily business communication through emails, letters, direct messages, forms, or invoices seeking responses from colleagues or clients. Another purpose could be persuasion, where you encourage the reader to make a decision or take action, such as buying a product or using a service. This type of writing is aimed at impressing the reader, highlighting the value of a particular product or service. Think about, say, project proposals, sales pitches, marketing emails, advertisements, and press releases. Having a clear purpose guides your language and how you'll structure the message. A single, well-defined purpose enhances clarity and effectiveness, helping you achieve your goals seamlessly. Once you know the purpose of your message, it's important to consider the audience of the message.

In the course of your daily work, you're likely to engage with colleagues from various disciplines. Consider whether you're addressing the message to a vice president or a team member. Understanding your audience will help you gauge the appropriate level of communication and tailor your writing accordingly. Depending on your audience's background, knowledge level, and priorities, you can determine the tone, formality, and content of your written communication.

Apart from the purpose and audience, the tone of the message is another essential aspect of professional communication. Knowing when to use a conversational tone versus a professional tone in your writing is very important. In technical documents, you might dive into complex terms and scientific jargon, but in everyday business communication, it's perfectly fine to use simple words and even contractions. When dealing with investors, a formal tone might be necessary, but when engaging with customers, keeping it conversational often works better.

Always be respectful and polite. Readers will be less receptive if your language doesn't convey respect and professionalism. Use appropriate greetings, titles, and names in formal emails and letters. Be sensitive to cultural differences and wherever it makes sense use gender-neutral language. Be aware of any unconscious biases that might sneak into your writing. Try to focus on the positive rather than the negative whenever possible. Being clear about your purpose and audience and using the right tone can increase efficiency and speed up decision-making. Think about your own communications. Do you consider your audience when writing a professional email? How do you adjust the tone of your message for your audience?

If you know why you're writing and who you're writing to, you can then move on to how you'll write. Focusing on your writing is crucial because it's likely to affect the response you receive from your colleagues, managers, or customers. To get the desired result from your audience, you need to recognize strategies for crafting effective and professional written communication. Studies indicate that our attention spans have dwindled over the years, now standing at just around nine seconds. That's why it's a good idea to provide the most important information first. Put the key takeaways or summary of your message at the start. Whether you're communicating via email, text, or in a collaboration space, it's best to start with the "why" behind the message.

While most messages are short, some require a messaging hierarchy where you put your most important information first and add supporting details later. State your purpose either in the subject line or the opening line of your communication. Using brief bullet points to support your main message can help decision-makers reach a conclusion quickly. I think a really important starting point for communication is determining the "why". So, what's the purpose of the communication? And then being able to build a case for that. I was working with a senior director at a very large Fortune 100 company, and he had a large team in India, and he was having a very difficult time getting travel approval to go to India to meet with this big team of 300 people.

So, as we talked a little bit more, one of the things I immediately noticed is that he was very happy and he laughed a lot, and he was jovial and uplifting and everybody wanted to talk with him, but he couldn't get any of his initiatives through because nobody really took him seriously. The vehicle for the communication was incredibly important. So, the fact that he was having this conversation with his manager verbally and he was very light-hearted and he laughed a lot, that was part of the problem. And so, we talked a lot about the vehicle that he should use to communicate with his manager. So, he would tell his managers that he needed to go for team building, and they just didn't understand the purpose. They didn't think that was a good enough reason for him to make an expensive trip to India.

So, we worked on really defining the purpose of his trip. And so, he said, well, I need to go because I have to deliver the vision. I have to make sure that all of my individual contributors and my managers are lined up behind the vision, and they have to be able to say no to non-essential activities. And then we built a business case for why that would help to move the business forward and we looked at the increases in efficiency and effectiveness on getting the team on the same page and everybody moving in one direction. So, as a result of that, he was able to get his travel approved and he made the trip to India, and he developed relationships with his management team. And he had identified all of his high-potential performers on the team. In business communication, it's important to be formal and direct. Using the active voice makes the content more direct and easier to understand. Ensure that the information you provide is relevant, value-additive, and complete.

If your content is irrelevant to the audience or contains inaccurate facts, it undermines your message. Avoid slang and other language that might sound informal or offend the reader. Don't use jargon, buzzwords, or acronyms. Your reader may be unfamiliar with these and lose interest in your content. Use "you" to address the reader, "I" to express your personal viewpoint, and "we" to refer to your company. Given the overload of information we all experience, be clear and concise. This helps people to quickly understand and act upon your message. Cut unnecessary words and sentences that don't support your main point. Avoid using too many prepositions. For example, you could use the word viewpoint instead of point of view. Use action words wherever possible, for instance, instead of provided protection to, write protected, before you send, review your message for clarity and concision.

Another key strategy for crafting your professional written communication is to use the appropriate tone. Although professional writing tends to be formal, it's perfectly fine to tone it down for informal messages. But when addressing someone in a position of authority or whom you don't know well, it's best to maintain a formal tone. Once you pick a tone, use it consistently throughout your document or message. Choose words that resonate with your audience and their interests. For example, when drafting a press release or newsletter, you'll likely opt for friendly language. For websites and presentations, use a conversational tone to create a dialogue with the audience. If your organization has a writing style guide, consult and follow it to ensure the right tone and vocabulary.

And to the extent possible, keep the message short. Research indicates that our brain's processing is highest when reading short and simple content. When you keep your sentences short and simple, using familiar words, your readers don't have to exert themselves to understand your meaning. Try to get your point across in as few words as possible. Use short sentences, 25 words or fewer, and paragraphs with no more than 3 or 4 lines. Maintain one point of focus in each paragraph. Consider breaking long sentences into bullet points and using a readability tool to reduce the length and complexity of sentences. Think about business communications you've gotten in the past. How do you react when you get a long, rambling email that takes forever to get to the point? How could you make such an email short and simple? What steps do you take to review and revise your own messages?

5. Video: Tailoring Your Communication for Different Channels (bs_acm36_a01_enus_04)

In this video, you'll learn how various channels of communication can be optimized for impactful professional writing.
recognize how various channels of communication can be optimized for impactful professional writing
[Video description begins] Topic title: Tailoring Your Communication for Different Channels. [Video description ends]
So, the communication, the form of the communication, the form of the written communication, as well as the channel is critically important when you're working on large, complex initiatives. You typically have multiple audiences who need to receive the message. You have different requests or asks for each audience. And so, what we really did as a team, we were getting ready to launch a major initiative to deliver a $100 million to the company within 12 months. And so, we had to be crystal clear on our communications. And so, the first thing that we did was we identified all of the audiences who would need to receive the communications, and then we determined what channel we should use to reach those executives, and then what the call to action was for each audience and then what our expected outcomes were.

So, for example, when we had large executive readouts, we made sure that we were sending them an email and a PowerPoint presentation. So, a clear written communication in advance of the executive readout, and we would hold the meeting, have the presentation, they could see it in advance, and then we followed up via email with action items and next steps. For urgent requests for executives, we would always use email, but we would also follow up with a voicemail and a text, and then we would contact their executive assistant if necessary, to schedule a meeting. For large team readouts, we would put those messages in collaboration spaces, which are broadly used, of course, today.

But in those collaboration spaces, it was really clear that we outlined the purpose of the communication and then what the calls to action were and the roles and responsibilities so who the owners were. Within broad-based communications to the entire company, we would again send an email with embedded links, and then we would also include videos to make sure that the messages were very clear, and they had multiple ways to consume the information, and then we would have calls to action. Externally when we were communicating with customers, with partners, with the broader market, we would either communicate through the salesforce or our partners, again, giving them the appropriate information in writing, and then we would brief the press. So, making sure that we were very clear again what the purpose of the communication would be or what it was, and the calls to action.

And so, that helped us to be very effective as a part of this initiative. And we ended up delivering a $184 million year over year. So, it was very successful. Communications, written communications was a critical component of that. Most professionals use different communication channels for internal and external communication. The communication channel you choose may depend on the culture of your organization. While some organizations use emails extensively, other organizations mandate all communication to go through collaboration spaces only. In any case, it's important to adapt your writing based on the communication channel you use. To do this, you need to recognize how various channels of communication can be optimized for impactful professional writing.

Email tends to be the most formal form of written communication to correspond with specific recipients and create a record of communication. Crafting effective emails is essential to ensuring a smooth flow of important information. A well-crafted email helps the sender showcase their professionalism and strong communication skills while sharing their key message. An email reading, I need your feedback on the draft agenda. Please send your edits by 10 a.m. tomorrow, states the message and expectations clearly. Avoid the common mistake of providing too much information. Don't make your audience search for your request. Consider what matters most to your reader and highlight it. Put the main point or ask in the first few sentences and then provide the details and context. You can call out the ask in the subject line to let the recipient know that they're expected to respond to the email.

Another common channel is using text messages, team chats, or collaboration spaces. These serve as platforms for quick, informal updates. They're mostly used for sharing project progress within a team. In large collaboration spaces with many members, however, it's common to encounter issues. There's often confusion about who should act on a request and its priority. Requesters might feel frustrated when their messages go unanswered in these types of forums, where it's easy to miss information. To avoid this situation, be open and transparent about what you're asking for and clear about whom specifically you're addressing. And remember, these are often seen by a lot of people. Temper your language and stay positive. Avoid being negative in a team chat.

If you need to be harsh to be direct, do it through a private one-to-one channel. In contrast presentations are commonly used to communicate with a large audience. They're used to outline and advance program initiatives or tell a story to higher-ups or customers. To create an effective presentation, develop a goal and key takeaways based on what you want your audience to learn, feel, or do after the presentation. Structure your presentation around the central theme. You can start with an attention-grabbing introduction to the main point, explain why it is important, and list the key takeaways. Use stories, examples, and evidence to explain each main point. End the presentation with a strong summary, restating the ask with a call to action. Use storytelling techniques like setting a scene, showing a conflict and resolving it, and sharing lessons learned to engage your audience.

Finally, website content and blogs are communication channels that help communicate the value you provide to your customers and shareholders. They are best suited for sharing information with an external audience. It can help to use survey or marketing data to create customer personas that represent your target audience. Then you can adjust your tone and language to suit that audience and what they want. Here again, you can appeal to the emotions of the reader by structuring your content around a story.

You want to find ways of keeping your reader hooked. Make them want to keep reading to find out what happens next and how your products or services can help them solve their problems. Different communication channels meet different communication needs, whether it's getting information for tomorrow's finance meeting or convincing customers your shoes are the most comfortable. You can optimize your message by choosing the right channel and adjusting your writing to best take advantage. Think about your job. Which communication channels do you use most often? How does your audience respond to your messages? How can you adjust your language and tone to best suit the channel?

Whether we like it or not, people judge us based on how we communicate our tone, style, level of detail, clarity, and relevance to the business. We're also judged on accuracy and grammatical errors in our messages. It's important to think about how to ensure clarity, grab the reader's attention, and project positivity and confidence in our writing. And that's why you need to recognize best practices for leveling up your professional writing skills. Media training is one of the most valuable experiences that I've ever been through in my entire life. If you ever have a chance to go through media training, I would highly recommend it because it absolutely feeds everything that you do from a written communication's perspective, and it's pretty simple and straightforward.

And the tool for media training is the inverted pyramid. And so, what that means is that you put your most important information at the top of the pyramid. So, let's think of an example. For example, you're working on a disaster preparedness program. And you know that if people implement this program and what the requirements are of the program, you're going to increase the number of lives saved by 75%. So, that becomes the top of your pyramid, that implementing this program will result in a 75% increase in life saved if we have a disaster. I think one of the most important reasons to have a simplified message and to think in terms of this inverted pyramid is because you won't be searching around for extraneous detail, and it's much easier to remember.

So, you can repeat the message to anyone. Number 1, by implementing this plan, you can increase life savings by 75%. You need to create a plan. You have to be able to determine the immediate actions. And then you have to have a communications plan to follow up. So, when you can do this, you come across in a much more positive and confident way than if you didn't have a simple process and methodology to communicate. There's a common saying that great writing is rewriting. While you may not always have time to rewrite on the job, it's best practice to organize your thoughts before you start writing. Avoid organizing while you're writing. That tends to make your writing less structure, repetitive, and more likely to drift off track.

A good way to start is to brainstorm about everything you think is important to include. You could do this on a piece of paper or another document. List your ideas until you identify your key point and information. This becomes your focus. Everything else you include should support that key point and help your readers understanding. Then outline your content and start writing. Most people want you to get right to the point, you need to grab the reader's attention quickly. This means your content must be relevant, well-structured, and concise, keeping your writing free of factual and grammatical errors and providing only relevant data establishes your credibility. Using short, punchy sentences, and simple syntax helps keep your audience reading. Positive messages and phrases appeal to readers.

It's best practice to project positivity and confidence in your writing. When you use positive phrasing, your readers are more likely to respond positively. Positive messaging promotes collaboration and willingness to listen to your ideas. When people are approached with positivity, it changes the way they react. Avoid using an accusatory tone. Don't assign blame for problems, but rather focus on ways to mitigate and fix them. Reframe the negative as opportunity. Focus not on this thing went wrong, but instead on here's a chance to improve this thing. Finally, take the time and effort to proofread and edit carefully. Grammatical and spelling errors put your message in a poor light.

Good writing presents you as professional and competent. Proofreading and editing both improve your writing and let your audience focus on what you have to say without being distracted by errors. Here's a secret no one notices good writing, but everyone notices bad writing. Use spelling and grammar checks if you have them. Make sure everything makes sense and says what you want it to say. If you have time and it's an important piece of writing, for example, for press release or in a presentation, get someone else to have a look. A fresh set of eyes can find things you may miss. Stay far away from awkward fonts and formats, including those copied and pasted from other documents. Avoid using underlining in emails or web content. Readers can confuse the text with hyperlinks.

For lengthy documents and websites, consider using screen readers to ensure that your content meets accessibility standards. In many ways, good professional writing is just good writing period. But the needs of the workplace aren't exactly the same as the needs of a good novel or an engrossing magazine article. Professional writing must meet the needs of the professional doing the writing and their audience, but with the right mindset and by following a few best practices, you can up your business communications and come across as the pro you are. Now consider for a moment your own professional writing habits. How often do you ask your colleagues' opinions on your content? Do you ask for proofreading help? What's your process before hitting the send button?
