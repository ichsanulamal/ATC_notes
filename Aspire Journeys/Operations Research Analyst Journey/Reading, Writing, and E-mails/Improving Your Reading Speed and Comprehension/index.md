# Improving Your Reading Speed and Comprehension

### Reading Speed Improvement Techniques

#### 1. Determine Your Current Reading Speed
- **Average Reading Speeds:**
  - Ages 12+: 200-250 words/minute
  - Adults: ~300 words/minute
  - Professors/Executives: 550-750 words/minute
  - Competitive Speed Readers: 1,000+ words/minute

- **How to Measure:**
  1. Pick a random page from a book.
  2. Count the number of words on the page (average for the book).
  3. Set a timer for 10 minutes and read.
  4. Count the pages read, multiply by average words per page.
  5. Divide total words by 10 to find words per minute.

#### 2. Identify Your Purpose for Reading
- **Common Purposes:**
  - Grasping key messages.
  - Learning for application.
  - Reading for pleasure.
  
- **Adjust Your Reading Approach:**
  - Scan for keywords if answering specific questions.
  - Slow down for comprehension when applying knowledge.
  - Enjoy the text without worrying about speed when reading for pleasure.

#### 3. Recognize Bad Reading Habits
- **Environmental Factors:**
  - Read in well-lit areas.
  - Hold materials at a 45-degree angle to reduce strain.
  
- **Physical Comfort:**
  - Sit in an upright, comfortable chair to avoid drowsiness.
  
- **Vision Check:**
  - Ensure glasses are up to date to prevent eye strain.

- **Highlighting:**
  - Avoid excessive highlighting, which can slow down reading and comprehension.
  
- **Subvocalization:**
  - Resist the urge to say words in your head; keep your mouth busy (e.g., chew gum) to improve speed.

- **Mindfulness:**
  - Concentrate to avoid unnecessary re-reading. Practice focused reading to minimize distractions.

#### 4. Selective Reading Strategies
- **Read Selectively:**
  - Start with the title and table of contents to understand the main ideas.
  - Look for headings, bullet points, and keywords to identify core information.
  - Read the first and last paragraphs of articles for key points.

- **Efficient Reading Techniques:**
  - Read only the first and last sentences of each paragraph to grasp the main idea quickly.

#### 5. Hand Movement to Enhance Speed
- **Guide Your Eyes:**
  - Use your finger or a pen to follow along the text.
  - Start slow and maintain a steady pace to train your eyes to move in a straight line.

- **Peripheral Vision:**
  - Underline the middle part of the text to utilize peripheral vision, reducing fixation on margins.

#### 6. Reading Groups of Words
- **Practice Phrasing:**
  - Train yourself to read clusters of 3-4 words instead of individual words.
  - Start with light reading material to practice grouping.

- **Eye Movement Techniques:**
  - Divide text into sections (beginning, middle, end) and fixate on each area to capture the essence quickly.

#### 7. Improving Comprehension
- **Adjust Reading Speed:**
  - Slow down for key sentences (first and last) while skimming other content.

- **Note-Taking:**
  - Jot down main ideas and keywords instead of transcribing everything.

- **Vocabulary Expansion:**
  - Look up unfamiliar words to build your vocabulary, enhancing future reading efficiency.

- **Pleasure Reading:**
  - Balance training with enjoyable reading materials to maintain engagement and improve pace naturally.

By applying these techniques consistently, you can enhance both your reading speed and comprehension, making your reading experience more effective and enjoyable.
