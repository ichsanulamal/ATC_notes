**Video: Reading with a Purpose**

To improve reading speed, first determine your current reading speed. Average reading speeds vary by age and profession:  
- Ages 12 and up: 200-250 words per minute  
- Average adult: 300 words per minute  
- Professors/executives: 550-750 words per minute  
- Competitive speed readers: 1,000+ words per minute  

**Finding Your Reading Speed:**
1. Select a random page in a book and count the words.
2. Read for 10 minutes.
3. Multiply the number of pages read by the average words per page and divide by the time to get your words per minute.

**Determine Your Purpose:**
Identify why youâ€™re reading (to find specific information, learn, or for pleasure) to adjust your reading technique accordingly. Use techniques to improve your speed, then time yourself again to see progress.
