[Video description begins] Topic title: Discovering the Elements of Self-confidence. [Video description ends]
It's well-known that managers generally favor confident employees for interesting work assignments, leadership positions, and new projects. Confident people tend to be positive about their ability to do the work, whether they already have the required skills or need to learn new ones. Self-confidence means trusting yourself, your abilities, qualities, and judgment. It's an inner state formed by your thoughts and feelings. When you feel confident about your abilities, you're ready to take on challenges and motivated to work towards your goals. Let's explore the elements that create self-confidence. The first element is identity. Your personality, character, values, skills, and past experiences define your identity. A positive identity leads to greater self-confidence.

It affects self-confidence because being aware of who you are provides clarity, enabling you to set clear, specific goals and make better decisions. To understand yourself better, consider your personality and character. Are you confident that you're making a good first impression? Think about the positive aspects of your character that your friends appreciate. Values and skills also contribute to your identity. Reflect on the values that matter to you. Do you compromise your values to achieve desired results? Aligning your goals with your values and developing relevant skills can boost your self-confidence. Past experiences offer insights into your abilities and can reinforce your self-confidence. Self-respect is the next element that shapes self-confidence. Self-respect means liking who you are and being kind to yourself.

Trying too hard to please people and giving in to negativity, both have an adverse impact on your self-respect. So, do holding on to hurt or anger, lacking self-awareness, and not meeting your own standards. You can develop self-respect by setting clear and consistent boundaries and not allowing people to cross them. Attempting to please people in a bid to avoid conflicts can also affect your self-confidence. You cannot please everyone and trying to do so is futile. Believing in your own self-worth and not constantly seeking validation from others is critical for self-respect. Avoid questions like am I crazy? Do you think I'm overreacting or do I look good? They undermine your self-confidence. Competence is another element of self-confidence. You can develop competence by understanding your strengths and abilities.

Be confident in your abilities without being arrogant. Take note of your accomplishments to identify your strengths. Look for opportunities to utilize and enhance your professional skills. To project confidence, communicate your competency without self-deprecation, but avoid false confidence. When you lack skills or experience, admit it. Overconfidence and arrogance can damage trust the saying fake it until you make it can help temporarily, but it isn't an effective long-term strategy. Faking confidence is something you do for external praise or recognition. When you build your abilities on your own, you learn to believe in yourself without having to rely on external validation. Social acceptance directly affects self-confidence. This is because how we define ourselves depends on our sense of belonging and understanding. Relationships with the people in our social groups, including family, co-workers, school friends, or team members matter.

We can gain self-confidence through our interactions and experiences in these groups. We build our self-image based in part on our cultural history, background, and the people in our social group. Indifference from those who matter to us deeply impacts our sense of personal value leading to anxiety and loneliness. However, when others share our views and support our aspirations, we feel a strong sense of belonging, security, and positivity. This directly contributes to high self-confidence. I worked with this woman leader who had done lots of great things in her career and really had a list of impressive accomplishments, but she still felt a lack of confidence in herself, in her ability. And it really was starting to affect how she participated with teams and how she participated in meetings and calls.

She was reluctant to raise her hand and say, OK, I know this thing because she didn't feel that self-confidence inside her. One of the ways that we work with that, the way I work with clients on that is to remind them, to have them remind themselves really of their own past successes, you know, everything that they've done to get where they are, their skills, their abilities. It wasn't luck. And the more they can connect to that, to the skills that brought them where they are, the more they feel like, OK, I can handle it. When she started to believe in herself more, she started to believe in her voice more and used her voice in meetings, spoke up and, you know, politely, of course, but she was very vocal about what she knew, and people's view of her changed.

And she started to get more opportunities because people were in touch with her expertise. And so, just being conscious of how it was her skill, her ability that got her where she is, got her further. Self-confidence then isn't one thing, but rather a combination of elements working together. Think about a time in your life when you were brimming with self-confidence. What made you feel so confident? Who was around you at that time? How did your self-confidence show in your behavior?

[Video description begins] Topic title: Are You Confident Enough? [Video description ends]

Self-confidence is crucial for success in both your personal and professional lives. But it can be difficult to know when your confidence is legitimately earned. Reflection is the answer. Instead of downplaying your abilities, it's more important to have a realistic view of your skills and confidence level. Once you're aware of your current confidence level. Reflecting on the lessons learned will help you grow. A lot of us have grown up being taught not to blow your own horn, and that has translated for some people as downplaying what they're good at and that excessive modesty can lead them to doubt their own abilities because what you say over and over becomes the truth. Whether you're saying it to yourself or you're saying it to other people.
When I work with clients who have started to believe the stories they tell themselves about not being good enough or I'm not that good at this, excessive modesty. We've worked on helping them reflect on past successes and things they've accomplished and having them remind themselves about these things so that they start to believe in themselves. Once they started to pay attention to what they'd already accomplished, what they had already done, and really reminded themselves of their own skills, their own abilities, they were much more likely to raise their hands for new things. They were much more likely to try new stuff at work, at home. So, they ended up having many more opportunities presented to them because they presented as self-confident. Downplaying your gifts means you're not contributing what you were hired to do.

You know, people hire you for a reason, and if you downplay your gifts, you start to believe that story, and other people start to believe that story. And the longer you do it, the worse it is for your self-confidence. Let's identify some ways to assess your current confidence level. To assess how confident you really are, consider your current standing. Can you recognize your strengths and take pride in your accomplishments? If so, your self-confidence is high. Think about times when you were recognized for your achievements. Remembering these can make you feel proud and confident. You can also create a list of things you've achieved, no matter how big or small. Have you learned a new language, overcome a fear, mastered a new skill? These are things to be proud of. Analyzing your thoughts and feelings about past successes and failures helps you understand how you behave in different situations and identify your strengths and weaknesses.

Seeking feedback from others can provide valuable insight into how you come across to them. This helps you identify gaps in your own perception. People with a clear understanding of themselves and how others see them tend to have higher job satisfaction and better working relationships. They demonstrate greater personal control, empathy, and respect for different perspectives. To further assess your current confidence level, you can conduct a personal SWOT analysis. This allows you to identify your strengths and weaknesses and then analyze the opportunities and threats associated with them. Ask yourself specific questions in each of these areas. Seek out a detailed picture of your current self. Know what you're good at and areas that need improvement.

Strong people skills. Great. Not so good with processes, here's where you can get better. Use your SWOT analysis to set goals that leverage your strengths and minimize or mitigate your weaknesses. Look for ways to seize opportunities and manage potential threats. In this way, you can gain a deeper understanding of yourself and evaluate your confidence level. Leveraging strengths to overcome weaknesses is a powerful strategy. If you excel at listening but are always hesitant to speak up, use the insights you gain in paying close attention to others to find places to add meaningfully to a discussion. With repetition, you build confidence for speaking up in the future. The next strategy for assessing your self-confidence is to identify your thought patterns and behaviors.

Lacking trust in yourself leads to insecurity. Your confidence level drops. Ask yourself some questions. Do you frequently doubt your abilities? Are you constantly seeking approval and praise from others? Do you overcompensate? Are you hesitant to try new things? To understand more about your thought patterns and behaviors, think about how you react to difficult situations. If you constantly tell yourself that you can't do something, you'll likely avoid it. Low self-confidence often leads to self-doubt and fear of taking control. The fear of failure can prevent you from facing situations head-on or taking risks.

To overcome this, change your mindset. Expose yourself to challenging situations. If you feel uncomfortable talking to new people, for instance, start small by saying hello and asking them simple questions about themselves. People like to talk about themselves, and now you've started a conversation. You're overcoming a challenge and building your self-confidence. Take a moment and think about a time when you were faced with new opportunities. Did you take healthy risks even when you were not sure of the outcome? What did you learn about yourself from those experiences? Reflection and learning can help you say yes the next time an opportunity comes your way. It's a virtuous cycle. One good outcome leads to another.

No matter how confident you are, workplace challenges can really test your self-confidence. These could involve dealing with difficult coworkers, coping with performance evaluations, navigating unfamiliar processes, or a thousand other issues. It's important to recognize some techniques for managing workplace challenges. Each challenge you overcome helps build your self-confidence. Let's look at a few of these challenges and techniques for handling them. Having a micromanaging boss can make you doubt your abilities. While your boss might feel in control, you may feel resentful and frustrated. You might also feel that your efforts are undermined and you're not trusted enough to do your job well.
One technique to handle this challenge is to respond to micromanagement with neutral clarity. Ask direct questions, and listen to your managers' responses to understand their perspectives and expectations. Ask for clarity around project goals, requirements, successful completion parameters, and deal breakers. You can also ask how often you need to update your manager on progress. Listen attentively, then analyze your manager's answers objectively. When you respond, be clear and direct without being brusque or rude. If micromanaging affects your progress, discuss ways to resolve the issue. Explain how your manager's behavior impacts your work and express your concerns and expectations. I had a client once who worked with a manager who was a micro-manager. This client had a lot of years of experience in that field, but they had worked in a very different business model than this company had.

And so, naturally, when he came into this job, he was a little unsure of how his skills and gifts would fit that new business model. And he said so to his manager while his manager reacted by micromanaging every little thing, you know, that this every all the work product, all the meetings, and this led to this person who always thought of himself as very self-confident, to start to doubt himself and it started to erode that feeling of self-confidence that he used to have. His manager kept doing the micromanaging and kept being involved with every little piece of his work. And you know, when someone does that, if they are going to correct everything you do, tell you every period, every T to cross, then you're going to feel unmotivated. You're going to feel like, well, why even try when this person obviously can do it really well?

As a result of all of this micromanaging and, you know, the erosion of his self-confidence, he started to work on, how to retain that self-confidence, and build it by being very much more proactive and doing things, and then talking to his manager. And over time his manager started to see, he can do it by himself. He doesn't need me to micromanage every detail. And as you can imagine, he felt a lot better about his work. He felt much more engaged with the work. When a manager micro-manages their team, then they feel like, well, why did you hire me? And they feel less motivated, they feel less engaged with the work. They're much less likely to go above and beyond because they don't feel like they're valued.

Next, consider how performance reviews can impact your self-confidence. Instead, of focusing on the negative approach performance reviews with a growth mindset. View feedback constructively without being defensive, you can only improve if you know how you're really doing and whether you're on the right track. Think of it as part of understanding your strengths and weaknesses. When faced with areas in which you're underperforming, clarify the expectations, resources available, and the time necessary to complete tasks. Allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them. Be curious and take small risks to expand your skills and acquire new knowledge. Remind yourself that you have the confidence to tackle challenges and learn from them regardless of the short-term outcome. Another challenge is dealing with difficult coworkers. These are often people who spread negativity.

They can really damage your self-confidence. For instance, being called out in meetings for any mistakes or errors in judgment can be humiliating and damage your self-assurance. If you're new to the workplace, you may also feel threatened by your colleagues or have a critical boss. One way to cope with critical or uncooperative coworkers is through empathy and negotiation. Try to work things out with your colleagues and heal workplace conflicts. Reflect on whether there's anything you might have done to contribute to this situation. If so, own your own behavior, then take necessary actions to resolve the conflict. When faced with criticism, instead of being defensive, try to understand the perspective of your manager or coworker.

Focus on the message people convey, not their behavior. Sometimes negative behavior stems from underlying fear or loss of control and may not have anything to do with you. Consistently enforce boundaries with coworkers who may take advantage of you or your time. Don't take responsibility for others' negative behavior. Yet another challenge to your self-confidence is disengagement at work. You might have fallen into some bad habits or routines that affect your motivation. Getting into ruts at work can lead to frustration and questioning your self-worth. To handle disengagement, you should focus on what matters. Think about what you enjoy about your work and its benefits in your life. Work can be stressful and frustrating, but for most of us, it's also necessary. Focus on the positives of your situation.

What do you do well? What aspects of your work are fulfilling? When your energy runs low, find a way to reenergize that works for you. For example, taking a walk outside, spending time with loved ones, meditation or mindfulness, build healthy and happy relationships at work, forging strong connections, connect with coworkers you enjoy working with. It's another way to stay engaged and active. Say hello, take time to chat, or congratulate someone on a success.

Beyond that, though, look for ways to stretch yourself, seek encouragement and feedback from others, identify new skills or learning you can use to stay motivated. Staying in a comfort zone affects motivation and prevents you from seeking new opportunities. Instead, take on new tasks and responsibilities that can reenergize yourself and your career. These are just a few examples of the kinds of challenges you may face in the working world. Ultimately, by facing challenges head-on and overcoming them, you can build your self-confidence, making future challenges easier to cope with. Think about the challenges you face day-to-day. How do you approach them? How do they impact your self-confidence? How can these experiences boost your self-confidence?

[Video description begins] Topic title: Building Lifelong Self-confidence. [Video description ends]
Having a positive outlook on the world and recognizing your abilities can lead to more opportunities to improve your self-confidence. Identifying long-term strategies will help you build and enhance your self-confidence throughout your life. The first long-term strategy is to build competency through upskilling and reskilling. As adults, we have fewer natural learning opportunities than children, so it's important to create a development plan, leave your comfort zone, and work to acquire new skills. Adopting a growth mindset is key to nurturing and growing self-confidence throughout your life. Think systematically about the gaps in your knowledge and skills and work on improving them.

Think about skills you may need to acquire for the future and your career goals. It's also OK to follow your interests without regard for career development. You can grow you, read books, ask for training courses or stretch assignments, or find a mentor, be willing to try new things. Track your progress and expand your skill set. Once you have a list of skills to develop, prioritize them, set clear objectives, and assign timelines. Decide how to learn the skills one by one and evaluate your progress regularly. The next long-term strategy for building self-confidence is to be positive in your interactions. Consider that the way you speak to yourself and others has a significant impact on your confidence.

Avoid using negative language or diminishing your competencies as it erodes self-confidence and sends the wrong message about your skills. Reduce negative self-talk. Changing the voice in your head from sabotaging your efforts to supporting them is a powerful way to build belief in your abilities. Talk to yourself as you might a child or loved one, being kind, supportive, and compassionate. Increase positive self-affirmation. Tell yourself I am a smart and capable person, my ideas matter, or I am ready to seize the day. Write a list of your strengths and place it near your desk. When you're feeling self-doubt, looking at this list will boost your confidence. Present yourself confidently maintaining positive body language. When you sit straight, stand erect, or in power pose and smile, your posture immediately signals confidence.

Pay attention to your clothes and tone of voice. Reaching out for help when you need it is another strategy to build self-confidence. Many people avoid asking for help due to fear of rejection or appearing incompetent. However, asking others for help improves your sense of belonging and self-confidence. It's part of knowing and being comfortable with yourself. Reject your fear of rejection and don't underestimate the willingness of people to help. When you reach out to others, you not only get the help you need but also establish stronger bonds. You're engaging in meaningful collaboration.

Collaboration has the potential to maximize self-esteem. When we collaborate with others, we invest in making our relationships more positive and meaningful. We accomplish more and succeed more often. All of these things relationships, accomplishments, and success breed ever greater self-confidence. Self-confidence isn't just for the workplace, and it isn't just for career development. Rather, it's a quality that can enhance all areas of our lives and all stages too. Think about your life outside of work. What areas of your life can benefit from a greater sense of self-confidence? How can confidence make your entire life better?
