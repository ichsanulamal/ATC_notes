While there's no single, authoritative definition of effective learning, experts generally agree that learning effectively isn't simply the passive intake of information, acquisition through sitting and listening or reading. Rather, effective learning is an active process. It involves all of the senses. It's experiential. It's worth examining each of these characteristics in detail. First, effective learning is an active process. A good way to understand this is to consider the scientific method.
The scientific method has been used for centuries. It starts with careful observation or consideration of new information. This is then followed by questioning. This doesn't always imply or necessitate formal questioning. It can be an informal process of seeking out background or related information by asking for input, reading articles, or online tutorials. The answers to those questions or information that you get back, provide feedback. And then on the basis of that feedback, you make predictions. And finally you test those predictions.

That's the theory. But how does it work in practice? Suppose you want to learn how to drive a car. You begin by asking someone to teach you. What did that teaching consist of? It began with observation. Just watching that person driving. You also ask questions. And on the basis of the answers or feedback, you make predictions. For example, you were taught to reduce speed before taking a turn, because if you didn't do that, you would lose control of the car. After processing that information, you were able to make predictions. Knowing that you should slow down before turning in every situation, you predict that you should be even more cautious, further reducing your speed during wet or icy or otherwise hazardous conditions. Perhaps you then tested that prediction in a controlled or safer environment.

The second characteristic of effective learning is that it involves the senses. Think about how young children learn by playing and exploring. It's what's known as sensory play, using their senses to explore and understand what's around them. It's an active process that stimulates all of their senses, sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. When learning is stimulating, children learn more, and they learn better.

And effective learning is experiential, learning by doing. Instead of sitting in a classroom listening to a teacher, whenever possible, effective learning is hands on. Adults learn most effectively when doing and applying. Consider cooking for example, you can read recipes and watch tutorials, but you learn how to cook by cooking. Learning through trial and error. Effective learning comes from curiosity, taking action, and then reflecting on the results. It allows you to integrate new knowledge with previous experience and move beyond just remembering something to actually knowing it.

According to neurologist Judy Willis, cross-referencing is when your brain retrieves data stored during a previous learning experience and then applies it to a new learning experience. The process of cross-referencing and data retrieval shows that you've genuinely learned rather than just memorized something. It's a key aspect of effective learning. Cross-referencing fosters three important benefits of effective learning, and each deserves a closer look.
First, effective learning sparks innovation. When you learn effectively, you construct new mental models, and new patterns and connections between systems and processes. You gain insights into the way things work and how they can fit together. You can then apply these new connections to create new ways of building things, or identifying new things to make. That's innovation. Consider the case of Louis Pasteur and the process of pasteurization. Initially, he was asked to find out why beer and wine went sour. He figured out that microbes, such as bacteria and mold, were responsible. From there, he discovered that heating these beverages killed those microbes, allowing them to last longer and making them safer to drink. He applied this process now known as pasteurization to milk. At the time, tuberculosis, commonly carried by cow's milk was a major public health issue. Pasteur's cross-referencing lead to an innovation that has saved millions of lives.

Effective learning also increases your adaptability. Being able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances allows you to quickly adjust to new business priorities and to take advantage of new opportunities. Through cross-referencing, effective learning gives you the ability to connect the dots between existing knowledge and new knowledge, enabling you to draw conclusions and rapidly adjust to new circumstances. Being able to comfortably adapt to new situations makes you better to able to manage uncertainty. With adaptability, new challenges, which might otherwise be intimidating, can be taken on with confidence.

Finally, effective learning helps you to grow professionally, and stay relevant, and remain a valued contributor in the workplace. The modern workplace is changing like never before. If you can't change with it, you'll get left behind. The willingness and ability to adapt to new technologies, and take on new responsibilities and new challenges is a valuable commodity. Professional success requires an ever expanding knowledge base. And the ability to apply that knowledge to finding effective solutions to novel problems. These could be anything from implementing new digital solutions to fundamentally overhauling your approach to teamwork. The point is that how well you both approach and handle change will largely determine whether you remain relevant in the workplace. Effective learning creates a responsive, well-rounded employee with a future.

Effective learning isn't confined to textbooks or classrooms, it can happen anywhere. Knowing how to learn effectively is important for everyone in the workplace. Traditionally, we regarded diligent note-taking or flawless memorizing as effective methods of learning something new. But, there are better ways to increase learning efficiency. What then are some strategies for becoming an effective learner?
One, is to have an inquisitive mindset. Effective learning begins with curiosity. Instead of accepting things as they are, curious and inquisitive people want to know why. They ask questions. Not satisfied by just knowing what happened, but curious as to why it happened. Being inquisitive means actively seeking to understand what you observe or learn. It means being open to learning. And if necessary to unlearning and relearning, refusing to take things as given and instead asking questions.

A further strategy for effective learning, is to involve all your senses. Using multiple senses, doesn't just make learning more interesting. It also makes it more effective. Imagine you're watching an online tutorial about a topic you want to learn about. You're using your auditory sense. But imagine now that as well as watching, you also follow along, reading the captioned text. Now you're using your visual, auditory, and verbal senses. The more senses you involve, the more you absorb the information embedding it in your mind. Neuroscientist Judy Willis says, the more regions of the brain that store data about a subject, the more interconnection there is.

Another good strategy is teaching others. Teaching is one of the surest routes to effective learning. It's a great way to consolidate new information within your brain. Fully absorbing and integrating what you've learned. Imagine you've just listened to a presentation on a topic you're interested in learning about. How would you explain what you've learned to a friend or colleague? Considering how you would teach something you've learned, gives you a firmer grasp and a deeper understanding of the newly acquired knowledge.

Finally, becoming an effective learner is to be resourceful, resourceful in this context means seeking out solutions to problems. The learning that is gained from this effort is more effective than if you just asked someone else for the answer. Resourcefulness is a mindset and no matter how great the problem, you know there's always a solution. It's especially valuable when facing difficult challenges. It makes you dogged, determined, and inventive. It helps you overcome obstacles and forge ahead and is a hallmark of being an effective learner.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Use Metacognition to Become an Effective Learner. [Video description ends]

When discussing effective learning, the concept of metacognition is worth investigating. Metacognition means simply the act of thinking about thinking. It's having a conscious awareness and understanding of your own thought process. When applied to learning, metacognition is the process of planning, monitoring, and understanding how you learn, and it can help you learn more effectively. Metacognition can be applied in virtually any learning situation, whether it's solving problems, learning a new skill, or broadening your knowledge base. Metacognitive practices enhance learner's capacity to adapt and transfer what they've learned to a new situation or context. It also encourages self-directed learning, which is central to becoming an effective learner.
There are four distinct phases of metacognition, which you need to be aware of when trying to achieve a learning goal. The first phase of metacognition is the planning phase. As a learner, this is when you think about what you want to learn, which may be your own learning objectives, or a learning goal set by others. You think too about how you will learn, the best approach to adopt, the most appropriate strategies to implement. These are all considered in the context of the learning goal.

During the planning phase, it's useful to ask yourself, what am I trying to learn? What's the objective or the task here? That's sometimes not so obvious. With that answer in mind, next ask, which strategies will help me achieve that goal? What other approaches have I taken or used in the past that could be relevant or useful?

The monitoring phase is next. This is when you implement what you decided during the planning phase. The approach and the strategies you deemed most appropriate, and most importantly, monitor how your learning is progressing. Think in terms of whether or not you're making sufficient progress toward your overall learning objectives.

If things aren't progressing as planned, it may be necessary to adjust or change your strategy. Ask yourself, am I on course to achieve my goals? Are these strategies the correct ones? Do I need a different approach? The third phase is the evaluation phase. This is the crunch phase, when you determine whether the strategies implemented to achieve your learning objective were successful. While this phase is fundamentally about whether you achieved your learning objectives, there are other considerations too.

Ask yourself, did I learn what I set out to learn? You also want to know what didn't go well or what could have gone better. Follow up by asking yourself which of the strategies that I used were helpful in achieving my goal, which ones weren't? What should I do differently next time around?

The final phase of metacognition is the reflection phase. This is a critical part of the plan, monitor, evaluation process. During this phase, you reflect on your learning, the process, the questions you posed to yourself and your successes and failures. Don't be afraid to self question, it's an important part of reflection. From here, it should be apparent what changes or adjustments if any, you need to make. More than just about thinking, knowledge, and learning, metacognition is about an awareness of those things. It's about actively considering and reflecting on the process of learning, and an important part of becoming an effective learner.
