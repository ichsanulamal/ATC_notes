Everyone loves a self-starter. Self-starters, with their ability to motivate themselves and their mindset of continuous improvement, are valuable team members. But while some people seem to be born with self-motivation, others have to develop it. It starts with the ability to self-coach. Self-coaching integrates the personal with the professional. It helps you be your best self, both on and off the clock. To understand how, it’s best to start by looking at some of the benefits it provides. Self-coaching gives you greater control over your career. It requires being accountable.

You set goals, create a plan to achieve them, and measure your progress as you go. Research shows that when you write down your goals, you’re significantly more likely to reach them. Assigning yourself specific actions keeps you moving forward. Further, self-coaching requires reflection and thoughtfulness about where you’ve been, where you are, and where you’re going. A thorough inventory of your strengths and weaknesses provides insight into your career path and how you can control it.

Self-starters use these insights to work collaboratively with peers and managers to stay fulfilled and driven at work. One of the most important benefits of self-coaching is that it can result in heightened mindfulness. This is the state of being present and aware without being too reactive to things around us.

It’s essentially a self-coaching practice. Using mindfulness practices can improve your work performance. Mindfulness at work helps employees focus more clearly on the task at hand, make better decisions, and become more productive. This is an important practice for reducing stress and burnout, which can decrease productivity and increase sickness and absenteeism.

Workplace stress has increased in recent years, but many Fortune 100 companies have been offering their employees mindfulness programs for at least a decade. A related benefit of self-coaching is that it encourages an improved growth mindset, which is the perception that your talents and skills can be developed and that you can continually learn and grow.

You’re never a finished product, but you're always getting better. A growth mindset gives you a can-do attitude that helps you take on challenges and complete tasks successfully. Mindsets are malleable, and with self-coaching, you can improve and refine your growth mindset as you progress in your life and career.

Negativity and doubt are often set off by certain triggers, like criticism from a colleague or a seemingly insurmountable problem. With a growth mindset, you can learn to recognize these triggers and be prepared to resist the insecurity and defensiveness they bring with them. Being your own coach is a lot of work. It can be difficult, and it can get very personal.

Many people resist looking at themselves honestly and critically, and on the surface, it may seem that nebulous concepts like mindfulness and growth mindsets aren’t relevant to your concrete career plans. But to take control of your career and your future, getting yourself in the right frame of mind is the first step.

How well do you know yourself? To what extent do your values guide your decisions? Performing a thorough self-assessment is an important way to take stock of your life and your career. To help you, there are some useful self-assessment tools you can employ to get a clear look at your personality, your values, and your strengths and weaknesses. Let’s look at three common and valuable types. The first type is personality assessment tools, which can provide insights into the very basics of who you are. Personality is the complex mixture of behavior, thought, and emotional patterns that makes every person unique. Most personality tests ask you a series of questions designed to identify your personality type.

Knowing your personality type can help you recognize patterns and make better decisions that fit with who you are. There are dozens of personality tests, each of which offers a slightly different perspective. Perhaps the most well-known personality test is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®, or MBTI®, personality test is based on the work of psychologist Karl Jung.

By asking a series of questions about your preferences, it defines your personality as one of 16 types. Your personality type is created from your answers to questions in four sets of binaries: extrovert versus introvert, sensing versus intuition, thinking versus feeling, and judging versus perceiving. Your personality type will be a combination of your preferences in these four categories. There are several other commonly used personality tests. These include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Enneagram, the Big 5, the DiSC assessment, and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire.

The point of these tests is to provide personal insight into aspects of your personality, and your strengths and areas of challenge, to help determine what you like or don't like. Regardless of the test, to get results that truly reflect your personality and render useful results, be honest to who you are and how you feel. Don't try to beat the test. Don't guess or try to come up with a "perfect" answer.

Take your time and don't overthink it. Values assessment tools, the next type of self-assessment tool, focus more closely on the things that are important to you. More specific than full personality tests, values assessments can show you how your priorities match your actual life choices. The most common values assessment is the Personal Values Assessment, or PVA, which assesses personal, social, and universal values.

As part of the test, you choose ten values from a long list that includes things like humor, fairness, independence, and professional growth. Identifying and articulating your values is crucial for career planning. If creativity is important to you, for instance, there are jobs that will welcome your innovative ideas. If predictability is more important to you, there are jobs where you won’t generally face the unexpected.

Whatever they may be, knowing your values helps you make better choices. The last of the three common self-assessment tools, skills and interests inventory tools, are basically lists. There are some career prep websites where you can take surveys on your skills and interests, but the main product is the same: an inventory of things you can do and things that interest you. Skills inventories are subjective, and many people tend to sell themselves short.

Make sure to include both hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills are measurable and easily observable; they’re usually things that you either can do or can’t. They are also usually specific to your field.

Technical hard skills, for instance, might include coding in C++ or debugging runtime programs. Marketing hard skills might include search engine optimization and data visualization. Soft skills, on the other hand, are a little harder to measure, and they are applicable across many different fields.

Common soft skills include communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Because they can’t be formally measured, many people undervalue soft skills, but they’re essential to most working environments and are often much harder to learn and master than hard skills. Your interest inventory should also be as wide-ranging as possible, including everything that is of even slight interest to you. Even a general interest might form the basis of a career shift or promotion.

You can use this inventory to help guide career decisions. Suppose you’re interested in social justice. You can follow that and look for projects that incorporate it. You can consult with your manager about ways to integrate social justice into your current job, or any opportunities that include an element of social justice. When your interests help inform your career decisions, you’ll find work more fulfilling. Introspection and self-assessment are the heart of self-coaching. You may feel uncomfortable digging deeply, but you’d feel the same with a professional career counselor. As your own coach, you must be honest and open. The more you know about yourself, the better a coach you'll be.

4. Video: Silencing Your Negative Self-Talk (bs_ape07_a02_enus_04)

Negative self-talk is the voice in your head that tells you you’re not good enough. It prevents you from growing, from being happy and fulfilled. It holds you back and if unchecked, it kills your motivation. In this video, you will learn techniques for resisting negative self-talk.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Silencing Your Negative Self-Talk [Video description ends]
“I can’t do it. It’s too hard. I’m in over my head.” Negative self-talk is the voice in your head that tells you you’re not good enough, that you’re incapable of making positive changes in your life. This voice prevents you from growing, from being happy and fulfilled. It holds you back and holds you hostage. Unchecked, it kills your motivation. But it is possible to resist negative self-talk. Let's explore three popular techniques that can help you gain control over your negative self-talk.

One technique is recognizing and silencing your inner critic. Sometimes your inner critic may speak in the voice of a real person – for example, a parent, a partner, a teacher, or a manager. Sometimes it’s you, yourself. Other times, your inner critic is just a feeling – a nagging sense that you’re not enough. Your inner critic keeps you from challenging yourself, berates you for imperfections, and tells you to always expect the worst.

To resist your inner critic, you need to slow down, recognize it, and listen to what it’s telling you. Practicing mindfulness – the state of being present and aware – is a good way to get to know your inner critic. Write down what it’s telling you and then ask yourself: are these things that I would ever say to someone else?

Why am I letting someone say this to me? Separating yourself from your inner critic helps you banish it. And then replace it with a supportive voice that will talk back. Is your inner critic disparaging you for not working hard enough? Your supportive voice can remind you of everything you’ve accomplished and all of the challenges you’ve overcome. Use your inner supporting voice to counterbalance and ultimately replace the inner critic. As negative self-talk is rarely based in reality, another technique you can try is to examine the evidence.

Examining the evidence is particularly useful in resisting the temptation to assume the worst possible outcome. Many people jump to negative conclusions, that any setback or error will lead to disaster. You missed a deadline? You’re sure to be fired. You said something that might be taken the wrong way? Everyone will shun you.

When you find yourself assuming the worst, stop, take a deep breath, and think clearly about the likely actual outcome. If you made a mistake, is it really likely that you’ll be fired? What happens to other people who make mistakes? Examining the evidence works with other kinds of negative self-talk too. Emotional reasoning, for instance, is when you rely on your emotions, rather than facts, to define your reaction.

Take stock of the situation and ask yourself if the facts support your emotional reality; in most cases, they probably won’t. A third technique for resisting negativity is to reframe the situation in a positive light.

Positive reframing is looking at a situation and seeing the potential upside, rather than focusing on the negatives. You missed that deadline? It’s a great opportunity to learn how to budget your time better and reexamine how you prioritize tasks. A project seems too difficult?

Here is an opportunity to reach out to your colleagues for their advice and experience. Here is an opportunity to learn something new. Life and work are filled with experiences. Whether they are positive or negative depends on how you frame them. Virtually everyone has an inner voice, whether positive or negative. By employing some useful techniques, you can train your voice to be supportive. You can use it to remind yourself that you can be and do better, coaching you to learn and grow.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Committing to Action by Setting Goals [Video description ends]
A major aspect of career coaching, whether you're working with a professional or doing it yourself, is writing things down. You assess yourself, take stock of your strengths and weaknesses, and figure out how to get from where you are to where you want to be. You navigate that journey by goal setting and planning, where putting your ideas on paper creates a roadmap for your journey. This sort of career cartography, setting long-term and short-term goals, can be done in a variety of ways, but in all cases will benefit from taking some basic actions. They’re simple to state, but more challenging to complete. You can start by taking a bird’s-eye view and articulating long-term goals for where you want to go and who you want to be.

Think at least five years in the future, maybe even as far out as ten years. These goals should incorporate the things you know about yourself: your values, your interests, your preferences for how you like to work, and the skills you have or want to develop. Long-term goals tend to be conceptual in nature – that is, they describe in broad terms the type of work you’d like to be doing and how you’d like to be doing it.

For example, maybe you’d like to lead your department within the next five years. Maybe you’d like to transition into a new area or role or career. Maybe you’d like to return to school and earn an advanced degree in a different field over the next decade.

Since these goals are conceptual by design, another useful action is to break your long-term goals into shorter-term goals to help you get there. Short-term goals focus on the next one to three years. They are operational in nature, the specific steps and actions you’ll take to reach your long-term goals.

Short-term goals should be achievable and measurable – items you can check off a list. Suppose you want to be a team lead within five years. Think about the steps you need to take to get there.

You might start by getting your supervisor’s buy-in. They need to be aware of your goals so they can support you. And since your goal involves a promotion, it’s especially important that your supervisor has opportunities to watch you reach that goal. Next, you need to identify the job requirements. Your company probably already has a job description for the position.

Use that as a starting point. Then meet with current team leads to add depth and nuance to your understanding of what the job requires. There may be soft skills like negotiation or conflict management that aren’t mentioned in the official job description. Based on your understanding of the job requirements, you might need to acquire any missing credentials, so look into how to get them.

Explore online courses and certification programs. Whatever your short-term goals may be, they are milestones, the landmarks on the journey to your ultimate destination. Share them with your friends, colleagues, and supervisors.

Studies have shown that people who share their goals with others have a greater chance of success. Making your goals public, as it were, helps hold you accountable and provides motivation for meeting them. As you achieve your short-term goals, another important action that many people ignore is taking the time to celebrate these milestones.

It’s easy to get discouraged while you’re toiling away, when the end seems impossibly far off. Long-term goals, by definition, take a long time and a lot of effort. But one benefit of short-term goals is that they are achievable within a shorter time. And those achievements should be celebrated. Meeting a goal is being successful.

It’s progress. Your celebration doesn’t need champagne or caviar, but success should be recognized. Setting goals can be daunting. Imagining life in ten years can feel overwhelming.

But by taking steps to define where you want to be and breaking it down into a series of individual, achievable milestones, you create a path you can follow toward your ultimate goal. Just don’t forget to stop and celebrate your progress along the way. Your coach insists.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Developing a Professional Growth Plan [Video description ends]
The pinnacle of self-coaching is a professional growth plan – a detailed description of where you want to go and how you’re going to get there. But like any plan, if it’s going to work, it needs to be well thought out and allow for contingencies. Let's work through the five steps you can follow to help you design a professional growth plan. Step one in developing a professional growth plan is simply to state your objective. What do you want to achieve? Choose one skill or competency that you want to improve. Then add a statement addressing where you would like to be when you’ve reached your objective.

The more detailed you can make your statement, the better. People who envision their goals in detail are much more likely to be successful. Your objective should also be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. And it should align with your long-term career goals, as well as your values, interests, and preferences for how you want to live and work. Step two is to assess your performance gap. This gap is the difference between your current state and your desired state.

It tells you how far you are from your objective. Performance gaps can include skills, education, and experience. Don’t think of this step as some litany of personal deficits; it’s just an honest snapshot of where you are and part of the planning process. Step three in developing a professional growth plan, then, is to create an action strategy.

This comprises detailed actions that specifically address the performance or skills gap and enables you to close it. This might mean taking online courses or training offered by your company. It might mean seeking out stretch assignments or cross-disciplinary projects. It might mean going back to school. In any case, it means finding a way to learn what you need to know or develop skills you need to have.

Step four in your professional growth plan is to measure your results. Measuring progress is fairly straightforward if you’re addressing skills or education gaps. Certification and degree programs contain intrinsic performance metrics; if you don’t meet their criteria, you don’t receive the certificate or degree.

Addressing the experience gap is a little harder to measure. You’ll have to spend some time figuring out how you’ll know that you’ve achieved the level of experience you need. For this, it’s helpful to work with team members and team leaders. They can help articulate the key factors that indicate that you have the experience you need.

Finally, because the professional growth plan is circular, step five is to plan for continuous improvement. This means you’ll repeat steps three and four – creating action strategies and measuring the results – continuously. The pace of this cycle doesn’t need to be lightspeed; you don’t need to be constantly moving from one growth plan to the next. But the overall plan is designed to show the big picture of your career as well as the specific steps you’ll take to meet your goals. It can be challenging to complete a professional growth plan.

Intense introspection is difficult for many people, and it’s not for the timid. But as your own coach, taking a long, hard look in the mirror is necessary. Your career matters to you and a professional growth plan will help you take charge of it.
