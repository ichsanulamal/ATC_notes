Developing Personal Accountability
If your manager’s approval isn’t quite enough to motivate you to put in that extra effort you need to get ahead, then maybe you’re ready to work on your personal accountability. Everyone must answer to an inner manager – an internal voice that tells you whether the job is done as well as you can do it. Choosing personal accountability means earning the approval of that inner manager.

In this course, you’ll learn the behaviors of accountable professionals, including stating commitments clearly and following through. You’ll also learn how some very common behaviors, like making excuses and blaming others, work against accountability. The elements of an action plan for developing personal accountability are provided. Finally, you’ll learn how the members of a team can improve their accountability together.

Personal accountability is part of being a professional. When you’re accountable, you do what you say you will, and if you fall short, you don’t make excuses and you don’t point fingers. You accept responsibility and work to make things right. And you learn from experience and move forward. Accountability makes you a valuable and trusted colleague and teammate. In this course, you’ll learn about why you should,

and how you can, develop personal accountability. You’ll also explore the benefits of accountability, the behaviors of accountable professionals, and how some common behaviors, like making excuses and blaming others, work against accountability. You'll also learn how to create an action plan for developing personal accountability and how to be an accountable team member.

2. Video: Appreciating the Value of Personal Accountability (bs_ape07_a01_enus_02)

No matter where you fall on your company’s organizational chart, developing your personal accountability yields important rewards – and not just for the company. In this video, you'll explore the benefits of developing personal accountability.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Appreciating the Value of Personal Accountability. [Video description ends]
Who do you see when you look in the mirror? Is it someone you’re happy with? Is the person you see looking back at you a professional who can be proud of the job they do? Even the most humble professional should take pride in how they do their job. No matter where you fall on your company’s organizational chart, developing your personal accountability yields important benefits, and not just for your company.

Those benefits add up to greater respect for that person in the mirror looking back at you. One advantage of developing personal accountability is improved job performance. Accountability leads directly to a sense of empowerment and ownership.

This ownership of the job you’re responsible for instills the motivation to deliver the best results that you can. It fosters a desire to learn and grow so that you can do even better, become more proficient, and exceed your organization’s expectations. That’s another benefit of accountability: it gives you greater control over your world.

When you truly hold yourself accountable for the consequences of your actions, you think carefully about those consequences. You see the scope of your possible impact begin to grow. Your ability to control outcomes and deliver results comes into focus. You unlock your personal potential and take charge of your own destiny.

When you take control of your circumstances, you’re better at keeping promises. This leads to another payoff for developing accountability: you build credibility and gain the trust of your coworkers. When your direct reports and peers know you mean what you say, it makes their lives easier. It removes uncertainty.

When your managers see that you can be relied on, they’re more likely to entrust you with greater responsibility and help you along your career path. Professionals who deliver what they promise make great teammates. In addition to holding up your end of the bargain for your team’s responsibilities, when you’re accountable, you don’t take part in laying blame or finger pointing when things go wrong or simply don’t work out.

In this way, accountability improves collaboration within teams. Accountability is infectious when responsibility is shared. Team members who see a colleague stepping up to help the team meet its obligations will want to contribute as well.

Accountability becomes a positive feedback loop. The end result is greater satisfaction among team members and better overall team performance. Your accountability, then, moves beyond the personal. When you take ownership and responsibility, you start a ripple effect that can produce the nice side benefit of spreading this accountability to others and strengthening the entire organization.

3. Video: Embodying Accountability (bs_ape07_a01_enus_03)

Being accountable means being responsible and taking ownership of your actions and behaviors. Personal accountability means applying that ownership to all aspects of your work. In this video, you'll learn the attributes of an accountable professional.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Embodying Accountability. [Video description ends]
Being accountable means being responsible and taking ownership of your actions and behaviors. Personal accountability means applying that ownership to all aspects of your work. To guide that application, there are some key attributes that accountable professionals embody as they go through their day-to-day work lives. One such attribute can be summed up in three short words: let’s get real. Accountable professionals clearly recognize the realities of a situation. To accept responsibility for an outcome, you have to know what’s required and whether the desired result is achievable.

You must speak up even when others don’t recognize or acknowledge likely failures. This can prevent catastrophe. Lack of accountability has led to loss of life in transportation, responses to natural disasters, and even spaceflight. While your job may not physically endanger lives, a lack of personal accountability can still have major consequences for your company, your colleagues, and your own career.

And this accountability is not just saying yes whenever you’re asked to take on a task or project. With a clear understanding of the circumstances, another attribute of accountable professionals is that they choose to be accountable for a needed result.

Your manager can assign you responsibility, but accountability is your choice, meaning you fully own the results. Owning results is not the same as agreeing to take responsibility if you fall short. Rather, it’s about striving to do what’s necessary to achieve success. In order to own an objective or outcome, the objective must be clearly defined. The next attribute of accountable professionals is that they state their commitments publicly. When you’re accountable, everyone knows what to expect from you.

Your commitment is clear and specific. If any part of the responsibility is shared, it’s spelled out. Then, you keep your commitments by delivering exactly what you said you would. And this is why the public statement is critical to ensuring that commitments are met. You’re not saying you’ll try to deliver. You're saying you will deliver.

Therefore, you want to make sure you know what you’re committing to. The final, and perhaps most important, attribute is that personally accountable people are action-oriented and they follow through. When you're accountable, you do what must be done to meet your commitments. You develop the discipline to act now, rather than postponing until later, and you stick with a project until it’s done right.

Developing that discipline is a big part of developing personal accountability. Taking responsibility is not something to do lightly. It means commitment and hard work. But it also means being a professional: reliable and trustworthy. It means being accountable.

4. Video: Are You Avoiding Accountability? (bs_ape07_a01_enus_04)

Life offers lots of excuses. Obstacles emerge, resources are limited, competing priorities take up your time. There are a lot of things that you can’t control, but you do control your own actions. In this video, you'll learn about behaviors that obstruct accountability.

Objectives
recognize behaviors that obstruct accountability
[Video description begins] Topic title: Are You Avoiding Accountability? [Video description ends]
Accountability and responsibility are hard. But avoiding them can be surprisingly easy. Suppose you agree to prepare a market analysis by the end of the month. But then, a few days after making the commitment, a major distribution breakdown results in an all-hands-on-deck emergency. The crisis drags on and you miss the deadline. You’re tempted to point to the distribution problem as a convenient excuse. It’s right there, waiting to bail you out. But blaming circumstances isn’t something accountable professionals do. They don’t make excuses. Life offers lots of excuses. Obstacles emerge, resources are limited, competing priorities take up your time. There are any number of things that you can’t control,

but you do control your own actions. To stay focused on developing personal accountability, it helps to recognize common behaviors that work against it. It’s common to point fingers and blame others. But blaming others denies personal accountability. You, and only you, are accountable for completing your projects on time. Suppose that when you agreed to complete the market analysis, you asked a colleague in Accounting to provide the necessary financial data. Your colleague promised to have it to you in a week, but then took two weeks. With the data late, you would have to put in some long days to complete the analysis on time. Technically, it is true that your colleague in Accounting shares some responsibility, but you’re the one who made the commitment. Another common behavior is to move the goalposts. But redefining the goal undermines your personal accountability.

Accountable professionals don’t move the goalposts. Now imagine that as the deadline for the market analysis approaches, you realize you won’t be able to complete it on time. Still, you work late a few nights to perform data analysis and provide summary statistics about the market. You figure that although you don’t have time to write up your conclusions and recommendations, the data alone could be useful. So, you turn in the statistical part of the analysis on time. When you turn in the complete analysis a week later, you could always say that you did submit the hard data on time. You could, but as an accountable person, you don’t. Instead, you accept the responsibility and the consequences, whatever they may be. Accountability is a choice you make for yourself and about yourself. It is not about other people or the company or the world at large. You become an accountable professional by focusing on how you succeed, not why you fail. Failures will obviously happen; the company and the world do intervene. But looking for ways to shift responsibility, tempting though it may be, gets in the way of personal accountability.

Pointing to a colleague having fallen behind is an example of blaming others. The employee who promised the complete report is still accountable. You, and only you, are accountable for completing your projects on time.
6. Video: Formulating an Accountability Action Plan (bs_ape07_a01_enus_05)

Personal accountability isn't a set of procedures, but an ongoing state of mind. Still, it can be useful to take some specific actions that help you as you develop your sense of personal accountability. In this video, you will learn about those actions and how to create a plan for developing accountability.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Formulating an Accountability Action Plan. [Video description ends]
Personal accountability is not a set of procedures, but rather an ongoing state of mind. Still, it can be useful to take some specific actions that help you as you develop your sense of personal accountability. First, make learning about accountability part of your development plan. Accountability gets a lot of attention in the business press and in schools of business these days. As part of developing accountability, set aside a few hours a week to learn more about accountability, from both a personal and leadership perspective. If you commute to work, consider audiobooks on the subject. Online courses are another great resource of information. Then look for an accountability coach.

You can learn a lot from an honest colleague or trusted coworker. Find a peer – not a supervisor or direct report – to evaluate your track record for keeping commitments and following through. Ideally, this accountability coach should be someone familiar enough with your job duties and performance to watch for excuse-making, blaming, and the other behaviors that get in the way of developing accountability. And they should also be someone willing to be straightforward with you when you fall short. The simple act of asking someone else to hold you accountable for your commitments is a major step. It means making the commitment to being committed. Of course, working with a coach is helpful only if you take their feedback and advice seriously, which is not always easy. You have to be willing to listen openly and acknowledge your shortcomings. Another key action is aligning your objectives to your commitments. You likely have a set of weekly, monthly, or quarterly work goals or objectives that you use to plan your time and activities.

As an accountable professional, you need to make sure these objectives prioritize commitments you’ve made to others. In other words, your commitments should be your top priority when planning your time. And any objectives that you are accountable for should be specific and measurable, with a set deadline. Whatever your goals and objectives, following through on your promises should be at the top of the list. Of course, you’ll face challenges. As part of your personal accountability action plan, you must anticipate what’s likely to go wrong and identify and plan for overcoming these barriers. A positive, determined attitude is crucial to accountability, but it must be tempered with realism.

Clear-eyed judgment must go hand-in-hand with optimism. Forethought and a mitigation plan are also essential to keeping your commitments. Finally, any plan for building and developing accountability should include periodic self-assessment. Keep track of your unkept promises, learn from them, and internalize their lessons. Ask for feedback about your performance on accountability from everyone, not just your coach. Talk with your supervisor about how you’re doing at meeting commitments. Your Human Resources Department may have tools such as 360-degree feedback assessments to help you gather insights from others and then use it to learn and grow. Keep in mind that accountability is an ongoing process. You never get perfect, but you can get better. Life and work are full of distractions. Creating and maintaining a personal accountability action plan helps you stay focused on becoming more reliable and more valuable to the company and to yourself. You can depend on it.

Whether you work in a corner office on the top floor or remotely at your dining room table, you’re part of a team. And teams also need to be professionally accountable. In this video, you'll explore actions that foster accountability among team members.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Demonstrating Accountability as Part of a Team. [Video description ends]
Whether you work in a private corner office on the top floor or remotely at your dining room table at home, you’re part of a team. And the team counterpart to individual professional accountability is team accountability An individual becomes accountable by choosing to commit to delivering a realistic well-defined result. An accountable team does the same. The complication is that a team’s commitment requires multiple people, meaning individual members of an accountable team all need to take some specific actions to faster accountability. First, all team members must share a common purpose and a commitment to specific goals. This shared purpose is the team’s overarching goal plus an understanding that the members are all in it together. Everyone succeeds or fails as one, with no finger-pointing or blame. And this agreement must be expressed publicly. Talk openly about your shared goals and commitments, with the promise to one another that you'll do what’s necessary to succeed.

Further, accountable teams set clear expectations for what each person is responsible for. Everyone needs to fully understand what they’re doing and when it’s due. Then you all must communicate throughout the entire process. Each member should report on their progress frequently, so that problems can be dealt with in a timely manner. If you’re facing a problem, it’s likely to impact your teammates. They need to know, honestly and fully, what, and how, others are doing. If you’re worried that a teammate may not be able to come through as needed, ask them. Then offer to help if you can. Accountable team members provide and acknowledge feedback with one another. Expressing and receiving criticism is important. While self-assessment is beneficial and necessary, most people wear blinders when it comes to some aspects of their own work. Hearing from others gives you another perspective. Using that feedback, you can improve in ways that you might not be aware of on your own.

And return the favor. If a team member is doing something that hinders the rest of the team, they can’t be expected to change if no one tells them. Communication is helpful for any group of people working together, but it’s critical for you and the other team members who want to be accountable for the team’s performance. Accountable teammates support each other by celebrating everyone’s individual successes. This motivates everyone and makes working together more rewarding, which improves performance. Accountable teams are those that practice all the habits and actions of a professionally accountable individual. As a team member, another part of your accountability is holding your teammates accountable. In turn, they are holding you accountable. Together, you all work to keep your commitments. As a team.
