### Reflecting on Personal Accountability

**Self-Reflection**
- Assess the person you see in the mirror. Are you satisfied with your professional self?

3. **Building Credibility**
   - Keeping promises builds trust with coworkers, reducing uncertainty and improving collaboration.
   - Reliable professionals are often given more responsibilities and opportunities.

4. **Enhancing Team Collaboration**
