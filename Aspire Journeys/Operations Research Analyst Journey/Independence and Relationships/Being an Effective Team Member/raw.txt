2. Video: The Power of a Positive Attitude (bs_atm02_a01_enus_01)

Objectives
recognize the effects that having a good attitude can have on a team
[Topic: The Power of a Positive Attitude.] HOST: You might not realize it, but the way you feel about being on a team affects the whole team. If you're enthusiastic and positive about being on the team, your teammates know it. And when you aren't – they know that too. Consider responses like these: "I'd rather handle that myself...not sure about that idea." "Maybe you'd better leave that to me..." "I don't have time to get into everything right now – you can just check what I put in my report..." "It's not really worth getting into this..."

These are all reactions you might have heard from a team member. Or have you maybe said these kinds of things yourself? Just one team member with a bad attitude can derail a team. It can demotivate everyone else. Make them not want to be involved. Make the whole team less effective. Now a positive attitude, that's equally powerful.

MARY: When Ashley joined our team, it changed everything. She made us feel like we could all pitch in and make a difference. Instead of competing with each other, we got excited about the work.

HOST: One benefit of a positive attitude – it makes a team more productive. Everyone gets more done when they're not wasting time on complaints, when they support each other instead of going it alone, or standing in the way.

Another benefit? A positive attitude makes for a more enjoyable team experience.

MARY: I went from hating my job to loving it...to feeling like what I did was important.

HOST: Rolling up your sleeves and getting a job done is always more rewarding if you feel like you're doing it for your team – the kind of team where everyone feels like they're in it together and all the team members count on each other.

HOST: A third benefit of the right attitude to teamwork is improved team performance. When team members are positive, they don't just get more done – they do better work, too.

MARY: I used to get so frustrated, and I felt like I was constantly under attack. Then I started to relax and listen to what other people were saying, and they listened to me too. And you know what? Our team has gone from getting negative reviews to doing some of the best work in the company.

HOST: When the people on a team have positive attitudes, it makes them more open to feedback – and that can improve the quality of the team's work. The truth is, everyone enjoys being part of an excited, dedicated group of people who support each other and do great work. Sometimes the first step in getting there is changing your mental approach to teamwork. Work on your attitude, and you could be surprised at the positive difference it makes for you and your team.

3. Video: Adopting a Positive Mindset (bs_atm02_a01_enus_02)

Team members' attitudes to teamwork can make or break a team. They affect how people on the team feel, how productive they are, how well the team performs. Sometimes it's easy to criticize – to see how the other people on your team are going wrong when it comes to working productively together. In this video, you'll discover strategies for adopting a more positive mindset.
Objectives

[Topic: Adopting a Positive Mindset.] HOST: Team members' attitudes to teamwork can make or break a team. They affect how people on the team feel, how productive they are, how well the team performs. Sometimes it's easy to criticize – to see how the other people on your team are going wrong when it comes to working productively together. But have you been honest about your own approach? It's possible that changing the way you think and act could make a real difference to your team.

There are ways you can adopt a more positive attitude to teamwork. One of these – and it's a good starting point – is to concentrate on team members' positive aspects. What are each person's strengths? What does each person bring to the team?

[Ashley and Mary are talking to each other.] ASHLEY: Remember how I'd go crazy because I had to nag Akira so much just to get updates on his work?

MARY: Oh yeah.

ASHLEY: But then you told me…

MARY: …what a great programmer he is…

ASHLEY: And I'm like...it's Akira's amazing programming skills that's really driving this project.

HOST: Instead of letting a teammate get under your skin, make yourself recognize how that person is an asset. That can really help. Another strategy? Focus on the benefits of working in a team. A group of like-minded professionals can always accomplish more than a single mind working alone. Right, Mary?

MARY: Well, I've always liked working on my own. So it was tough. But like with Akira? I mean, others on my team can do all kinds of things I can't. But the truth is, we need each other!

HOST: A final way to become more positive about your team is to accept mistakes, learn from them, and move on. Not just your mistakes – those of your teammates too. This is a tough one for most people to apply.

When something goes wrong, it can be hard not to look for someone on the team to blame. But instead, sit down and focus on what the team could do better...how it could improve processes, how to make it easier for everyone on the team to do their jobs well.

Sometimes mistakes can teach you as much as successes, and the way you respond to them can turn things around. When it comes to teamwork, don't underestimate the power of a positive attitude. Try putting the strategies for being positive about your team into practice, and sooner than you might think, you'll start seeing the benefits.

4. Video: What Being Proactive Is About (bs_atm02_a01_enus_03)

Great team members don't just check off tasks on their routine "to do" lists. Instead they're proactive. They take the initiative and get things done. They think ahead and set up systems that make life easier for others too.
Objectives
identify the characteristics of a team member who has a proactive attitude
[Topic: What Being Proactive Is About.] HOST: Great team members don't just check off tasks on their routine "to do" lists. Instead they're proactive. They take the initiative and get things done. They think ahead. And they set up systems that make life easier – not just for them, but for others too.

Let's consider what it takes to be a proactive team member. First, this kind of person is energetic and enthusiastic. And their energy is contagious. It spreads easily to other team members.

[Ashley, Akira, May, and Lauren are in a meeting. Ashley looks at Akira's work on a laptop.] ASHLEY: I'm so excited about this! Great job. Maybe we could even add to it...have users choose their own tools?

AKIRA: Thanks! Sure, that could work. I'll get on it today.

ASHLEY: Perfect. And Mary, let's talk about what graphics we need.

HOST: Proactive people take the initiative. That doesn't mean they're pushy, obnoxious, or aggressive. But they acknowledge their responsibility to make things happen.

By comparison, team members who aren't proactive wait for things to happen, and then react. That can be a problem because when the unexpected happens, they're not prepared.

When you hit one problem after another...just bump into things and try to keep on going...it can also be really stressful. Proactive team members are good planners. They think ahead...anticipate problems...prepare in advance. And when things start going wrong, a proactive person doesn't sit around – they take action.

MARY: That's what Ashley's great at...

ASHLEY: Thanks! Just part of my job. Thinking about what could go wrong, building extra time into our schedules, and figuring out backup plans. It's quite a creative process actually!

HOST: That's another thing about proactive team members – they're usually creative problem solvers. They search for signs of potential problems and find innovative solutions.

Something else proactive team members have in common...they're good communicators. Consider Ashley and Lauren's situation...

LAUREN: So we'll have to make this more interactive? We're changing our approach?

ASHLEY: A little, yes. It won't affect your work yet though, Lauren – Akira is handling the programming, Mary is on the sales chart graphics. We should have a prototype ready by the end of the week. It'll be great to see what you think.

HOST: The reason team members like Ashley are good communicators? They anticipate questions others might have, and that helps them be clear and thorough.

If you want to play a more central role in your team, strive to be more proactive. You'll inspire others to excel and you'll help your team meet or even exceed its goals.

5. Video: How to Be Proactive on a Team (bs_atm02_a01_enus_04)

If you want to play a more central role in your team, strive to be more proactive! You'll inspire others to excel...and you'll help your team meet its goals. Being proactive is about taking the initiative and getting things done...about being enthusiastic...about planning ahead, anticipating problems, and finding creative ways to solve them.

[Topic: How to Be Proactive on a Team.] HOST: If you want to play a more central role in your team, strive to be more proactive! You'll inspire others to excel...and you'll help your team meet its goals. Being proactive is about taking the initiative and getting things done...about being enthusiastic...about planning ahead, anticipating problems, and finding creative ways to solve them.

It's clear how that could help a team perform at its best. But it's not always easy to turn things around – to switch from a reactive approach to one that's more proactive. So how do you start? Well...you just start! You identify opportunities for action. Think about the work your team does, the processes it uses. What doesn't work as well as it could? Then figure out what you could do to make things better.

[Ashley, Akira, Mary, and Lauren are in a meeting.] ASHLEY: We're getting behind deadline on this one...

AKIRA: I know, but the client asked for changes and that means redoing a lot of programming work...

MARY: And completely redoing the sales charts we designed weeks ago!

HOST: So Ashley, how did you turn things around?

ASHLEY: I suggested that we change our approval process...have the client give us feedback more often, and much earlier.

MARY: Made a huge difference. Now the client reviews our work twice a week, sometimes more. And that means never having to redo weeks of work at a time.

HOST: Being proactive isn't just about having ideas and putting them into action. Remember that you're part of a team and for ideas to succeed, you have to get your team members' support. Sometimes introducing new ideas means dealing with fear or resistance to change. Consider how Ashley handled this...

ASHLEY: So Akira and Mary, you seem okay with trying out a new approval process. Lauren, what do you think?

LAUREN: I don't know. Seems like inviting the client to interfere more. Not sure if we need to add another complicating factor...

ASHLEY: I understand. This is really about minimizing the impact of client changes though.

AKIRA: That's right – I've been having to redo so much work!

ASHLEY: This new process could prevent that. You know, so the clients don't tell us what they really want only after much of the work is done.

LAUREN: I've definitely seen that happen! Okay. Let's see how the new process goes...

HOST: So to be more proactive...to help your team be the success it can be...don't sit back. Think ahead, have ideas, and talk them over with your teammates. Making positive changes can result in a stronger, happier, more successful team.

6. Video: Acknowledging Different Opinions (bs_atm02_a01_enus_05)

In this video, you will learn how to recognize and acknowledge team members' rights to have differing opinions.
Objectives
recognize how to acknowledge team members' rights to have differing opinions
[Topic: Acknowledging Different Opinions.] HOST: When someone presents an idea that's different from yours, how do you react? Do you argue? Smile slightly and ignore them? Or do you listen to their point of view with an open mind? The way you respond to differences...that's what helps determine how good you are at working on a team.

[Mary and Lauren are looking at work on Lauren's laptop.] MARY: I think we should move the instructions much higher up on the screen. Not force users to scroll for miles...

(BRASHLY) LAUREN: I disagree.

MARY: Okay. Why?

LAUREN: Eye-catching graphics hook users. Plus it will be extra work changing the template now, and if...

(ABRUPTLY) MARY: Well I have responsibility for this component. I don't think the design will do and I'm...

(UPSET) LAUREN: Fine. Whatever.

HOST: When team members can't cooperate...and when they don't treat each other with respect, the performance of the team suffers. There are two main ways you can prevent this. First listen properly before you respond and don't interrupt. Don't speak over, butt in, or cut off your teammates. For example, consider how the last part of the conversation we just heard could have gone...

(ENTHUSIASTICALLY) LAUREN: Plus it'll be extra work changing the template now, and if we're going to do that, we'll have to get the client's approval. I guess we could play with a new design, but we'll have to get Ashley to add an extra day to the schedule.

MARY: Makes sense. Thanks. I'll talk to Ashley. Plus, I could help with the work if you want?

HOST: Much better. And the second step for acknowledging a team member's point of view? Even if you don't agree, use supporting statements. That doesn't mean you've suddenly decided the other person is right. It just means acknowledging their right to have an opinion different from yours. Consider how this can work in practice...

[Akira and Lauren are looking at work on Lauren's laptop.] AKIRA: I'm not sure it's a good idea to change the way this is set up, but tell me what you're thinking.

LAUREN: Well clients keep complaining about the time it takes to configure these settings. If we give them a choice of accepting all the defaults, it will cut things down a lot.

AKIRA: I see what you mean. The problem is, every client has a potentially different reason for using this app. It's designed to be customized. So what do you suggest?

HOST: Statements like "Tell me what you're thinking" and "I see what you mean" are great ways to show you're open to hearing and understanding a teammate.

Today, more and more teams are global ones, and cultural differences...they can lead to misunderstandings. That makes it doubly important to be open. Listen properly and be supportive, and you'll benefit from being on a team where everybody's ideas are heard – where everyone pulls together, and getting the job done well is a pleasure, not a struggle.

7. Video: Demonstrating Respect (bs_atm02_a01_enus_06)

No matter who you are or where you come from, it's likely you want to be treated with dignity and respect. Your teammates do too. In this video, you'll learn how to demonstrate respect in the language you use.
Objectives
recognize strategies for demonstrating tolerance and treating teammates with respect
[Topic: Demonstrating Respect.] HOST: No matter who you are or where you come from, it's likely you want to be treated with dignity and respect. Your teammates do too.  All too often though, people on a team lose sight of this.

[Lauren and Akira are in a meeting.] LAUREN: I've looked at your latest module, and it's not right. Not sure you have the experience to monkey around with the original templates...

(ANGRILY) AKIRA: How about you actually do some work for a change?

HOST: This kind of exchange doesn't make anyone happy – and it can prevent a team from working properly and meeting its goals. Often when things go wrong, it's not so much because of what team members say as how they say it. If you demonstrate respect in the language you use, you'll get your point across more effectively – and you're likely to be treated with respect in return. So how do you do this?

One way is to use nonjudgmental, objective language. That's language that focuses on the issue, not the person. Consider how Lauren could have done a better job of talking to Akira...

LAUREN: I've finished testing the latest module, and we've hit some problems. I've got a list of issues we'll have to tackle. Could we work through them sometime soon?

AKIRA: Yes, sure. How about now, if you're free?

HOST: Instead of criticizing or belittling Akira, Lauren focused on the issue. She also did something else right – she said "I" and "we," instead of "you." It's best to limit your use of the word "you" when you point out problems. "You" statements sound like they're placing blame. "I" and "we" make for better teamwork.

A third guideline for demonstrating tolerance and respect – when possible, add provisional qualifiers to your statements. Consider some examples: "In my opinion..." "It seems to me..." "It's been my experience..." "Based on the data I've seen so far..." These kinds of phrases make it clear that you're open to your team members having other points of view...other valuable contributions to make. And that's a basic way of demonstrating respect.

At first, it can take a conscious effort to rein in petty frustrations...to stop being defensive or critical, and to use the right kind of language. But soon it becomes a habit. And when everyone on a team knows their opinions are valued...their work is valued, and they're treated fairly and with respect...that's when the team can really take off. That's when you get every team member giving their best and taking each other's efforts that much further than anyone could go on their own.

8. Video: Working Collaboratively on a Team (bs_atm02_a01_enus_07)

On a good team, everyone cooperates. On a great team, people don’t just cooperate – they collaborate. They combine their individual efforts into something greater, and they work as a single unit.

[Topic: Working Collaboratively on a Team.] HOST: On a good team, everyone cooperates. On a great team, people don't just cooperate – they collaborate. They combine their individual efforts into something greater, and they work as a single unit.

Ashley, your team has achieved remarkable things this year. What have you learned?

ASHLEY: I've always been a bit of a perfectionist – I end up trying to do everything myself. But I've learned to let go. To trust my teammates.

HOST: And when everyone specializes in different fields...everyone brings different talents and perspectives to the team...how do you bring that all together?

ASHLEY: Well, we talk a lot. We share information, insights, discoveries. Nobody gets left out of the loop. So even if everyone has a different role to play, we all know exactly what direction we're headed.

HOST: One way to collaborate on a team is to make sure you share pertinent knowledge with your team. That builds trust. It also prevents errors...the kinds of mistakes, false assumptions that can happen if people are missing parts of the picture.

A second way to encourage collaboration on your team – put the needs of the team first. It's not easy to sacrifice your own priorities, your personal likes and dislikes...your individual ambitions. But for a team to perform optimally, you have to do what's best for it – not you.

So being a great team member, collaborating with others...for you, does that involve making sacrifices?

LAUREN: I work hard – we all do. We all pick up whatever pieces we have to, to get things done.

ASHLEY: Yes. Sometimes that means doing work we don't enjoy. And me...sometimes I struggle to do things the team's way, and not my way. But it's worth it, being on a team that does great work.

HOST: On a high-performing team, personal goals have a place too. People on the team support each other's personal needs. Say someone has to leave earlier than everyone else, to pick up a child at school or attend a class – the other team members work around that. They make it work. And everyone is where they want to be professionally.

In a great team, you know what your teammates want to achieve, what you want to achieve, and what the team as a whole wants. That paves the way for everyone to collaborate...to figure out how you can all fit together and move toward achieving common goals. And when everyone collaborates fully, a team becomes more than the sum of its parts.

Let's review what you learned in this course. To become a strong and reliable team member, adopt a positive attitude; be proactive by identifying opportunities for action and getting the support of your team members; acknowledge and understand different opinions; show respect by using nonjudgmental, objective language; and work collaboratively by sharing relevant information and putting the needs of the team first.

Is a good communicator
5.
Is a good planner
Feedback:
Option 1:
This is a correct option. Proactive people are energetic. Their enthusiasm easily spreads throughout the team.
Option 2:
This is a correct option. Proactive people search for signs of potential problems and use creativity in analyzing those issues, which makes them good troubleshooters and problem solvers.
Option 3:
This is a correct option. Proactive people are good communicators. They anticipate questions others may have, which allows them to be clear and thorough.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. A reactive attitude can be of benefit – such as during a crisis – when you focus entirely on the issue at hand. But having a proactive attitude will help you prepare for and prevent crises.
Option 5:
This is a correct option. Proactive people are typically good planners, because they anticipate problems by forecasting what the team will need.
Option 6:
This option is incorrect. Reactive people typically get stressed, since they aren't prepared for the unexpected.
Question 2: Multiple Choice
What are some examples of being a proactive team member?

Options:
1.
An editorial team member gets her team to sign off on using a more efficient fact-checking process
2.

Option 2:
This is a correct option. Identifying opportunities for action, such as a missing checklist, is a proactive strategy for the HR team member.
Option 3:
This option is incorrect. Repairing a machine after it's broken down is a reactive strategy. A proactive strategy would include preventive maintenance to avoid the breakdown in the first place.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. Taking pre-emptive action by tackling a job in a different order is neither identifying an opportunity for action nor getting consent from the team.
Question 3: Multiple Choice
Which two responses demonstrate ways to acknowledge different opinions?

Answer
1.
We should re-examine the data to find the problem."
2.
"It's been my experience that data can be manipulated."
3.
"Your opinion appears to be based on the available data."
Feedback:
Option 1:
This is a correct option. Using the pronouns "we" or "I" instead of "you" demonstrates respect.
Option 2:
This is a correct option. Using provisional qualifiers like "It's been my experience" demonstrates respect by showing you're sharing an opinion, rather than placing blame.
Option 3:
This is a correct option. You can demonstrate respect by using objective language, rather than critical language.
Option 4:
This is an incorrect option. Using critical, nonobjective language and "you" statements does not demonstrate respect.

3.
You tell Sally the news about the rescheduled deadline immediately.
4.
You wait to tell Sally the news in hopes she can catch up and meet the new deadline.
Answer
1.
You tell Sally, "I have some spare time this afternoon. I'll help you get your work done."
3.
You tell Sally the news about the rescheduled deadline immediately.
Feedback:
Option 1:
This is a correct option. You're demonstrating that you're a team and therefore equally responsible for completing the work. This is an example of putting the team's needs ahead of your own.
Option 2:
This is an incorrect option. You're not working collaboratively to find a solution to complete the work. You also haven't shared the information you've learned about the change in deadline.
Option 3:
This is a correct option. The best approach is for you to be honest with Sally and tell her immediately. This will build trust.
Option 4:
This is an incorrect option. If you want to build an honest relationship with teammates, you need to make sure they have the same information as you.
