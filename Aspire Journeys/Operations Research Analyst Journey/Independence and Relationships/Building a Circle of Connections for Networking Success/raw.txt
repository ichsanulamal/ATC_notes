While most people understand the value of being connected with people who can help them succeed, many people don't actively work to create and develop strong professional relationships. In this video, you will explore the ways a business network can help you succeed at work.

There is something to the old saying "It's not what you know, it's who you know." And, while most people understand the value of being connected with people who can help them succeed, many people don't actively work to create and develop strong professional relationships. When looking for a new job, it's obviously important to have the right experience and skills. However, quite often, it's also knowing the right person – that is, being connected – that gets you in the door. Building a professional network is an ongoing process. It creates new opportunities to learn, grow, and advance your career. Let's look at how a business network can help you succeed at work. Business networks can provide necessary support for career growth.

No matter how well you're doing professionally, there will always be questions or issues that are difficult to resolve if you're working within a vacuum, without the kind of input and help a network of connections can supply. For example, some people are unsure where they truly fit in at their company and if their career is on the right track. Others may be struggling to master specific work tasks or processes. And others may be kept awake at night feeling overwhelmed by their workload or responsibilities. Isolated or unconnected, finding meaning or direction can be daunting.

But by drawing on the knowledge, experience, support, and guidance of people in a professional network, you can obtain valuable insights, clarity, and encouragement. A business network can also help you meet and connect with key company people and decision-makers. These are people who can substantially support your professional or developmental journey.

One way they can help is by coaching you through a new or challenging task, or by giving technical advice or assistance.

Another is by acting as a sponsor who aids your growth by assigning challenging tasks and the guidance to complete them. Yet another is through empathy and understanding of your goals, providing psychological support to face difficult situations. This could be something as simple as listening to your concerns and giving you advice or as complex as providing ongoing feedback and assessment. And significantly, these people can serve as role models, providing an example to emulate.

And further, a business network helps you gain new and different perspectives about your work from a whole range of people. When people of all hierarchical levels connect through business networks, it opens up a wide range of support, experience, and learning.

A robust network makes it a truly developmental network. Everyone benefits mutually by learning skills and gaining knowledge from each other, with the opportunity to teach what they know to others, making it genuinely reciprocal.

A diverse network, containing a broad range of viewpoints, exposes each member to new perspectives that may challenge their thinking and gives everyone involved a deeper understanding of how to reach, and exceed, their professional goals. While it's too often neglected, developing a strong business network is an important part of succeeding at work. It supports career growth, provides access to key people and decision-makers, and exposes its members to new and different perspectives about their work.

There's more to networking than collecting business cards. You might meet some contacts that way, but it’s passive behavior when you need to take direct action. In this video, you will learn key practices to build your networking connections.

There's more to networking than collecting business cards. You might meet some contacts that way, but it’s passive behavior when you need to take direct action. You can't reach out randomly and hope that the right people will cross your path. Networking requires active participation. You need to take every opportunity to put yourself in contact with people who can help advance your career. Building a circle of connections can be a daunting task. Knowing where and how to begin can feel overwhelming.

But it's a lot easier if you follow some key practices for building networking connections. A good place to begin is with joining professional networking groups. This could be anything from a casual social media network to a more formal professional association.

Participating in these groups – especially online – is a powerful way to quickly increase your network size. While traditional face-to-face networking can be time-consuming and expensive, online networking doesn't involve much commitment in terms of time and effort, and it generally doesn't cost anything. There are no travel or hotel expenses, for example, when you're networking online. Before joining an online group, however, it's a good idea to check a few things. Does it have well-defined objectives or aims? If not, it's harder to ensure that everyone's committed to the same thing. Are there clear membership criteria?

It's important that everyone has common interests and something to contribute. Are there regular, structured meetings with clear agendas? This is important to ensure meetings are useful and don't waste people's time. And, last, are members kept accountable? There needs to be some way to ensure everyone participates regularly and actively contributes to the group's success.

Another key practice is engaging with your existing contacts. Reach out to people you already know and see how you can provide mutual support. The aim is to develop your existing casual contacts into high-quality relationships. These are mutually transformational relationships because they're centered around mutual growth, learning, and influence.

Ideally, there's an altruistic exchange of ideas, which fosters creativity, growth, and new ways of thinking. In a high-quality relationship, you're a teacher and a learner at the same time. Existing contacts can also be a great source of new contacts. Your current contacts' contacts could really enrich your own network. Always make it a point to respond quickly and courteously to introductions to new people from your existing contacts. These introductions can be of real value. They can help you find new opportunities, new clients, and perhaps even new friends. When you’re introduced to a new contact, follow up.

While there are no hard and fast rules for how to follow up, there are some basic pointers that you can apply. Show interest and let them know you would like to stay in contact. And respond quickly – ideally within a day or two.

You don’t want them to forget who you are. Don't use a generic response; personalize it to the extent possible. No one wants to feel like they’ve received a form letter or e-mail. And don’t forget the contact who introduced you. Show your gratitude, let the referrer know how it went, and say thanks.

Connecting online with new people can also be a central part of building your network. Networking doesn't have to be face-to-face; it can happen just as easily and effectively through online channels. This is separate from joining professional associations online, and the first step to meeting new contacts online is to craft your online profile or bio with care and attention.

It's the first thing people see when new, potential networkers connect with you. First impressions count. Whether it's a potential client, recruiter, or potential collaborator, the first thing someone does when they connect with you online is check out your profile. And as they do, they're assessing you and deciding whether they want to get to know you or not.

Your profile and biography need to convey credibility and position your brand. This is about how you want to position yourself or how you want others to perceive you. Create a basic biography that includes a professional-looking photo, a short description of your work, and a brief synopsis of your interests.

You can prepare different versions of your biography depending on whether you intend to use it for social networking or for a blog or online article you've written. And be mindful of the need to build trust, which can be harder to establish when people can’t see your facial expression or hear your tone of voice. In online relationships, trust often comes from consistency.

That means commenting on the same topics or issues, having the same profile and photo across different platforms, and just generally being consistent in what you express and how you express it. Perhaps the most obvious way to deepen contacts is simply keep in touch.

Keep the relationship active and alive by regularly reaching out, even if it's just to share an article of mutual interest or meet up virtually to discuss new ideas. This involves being empathetic and available whenever a contact needs your help, and not just when you need something. A solid circle of networking connections is important to professional success, but it doesn't build itself. It takes time, thought, and effort. Although it can be a difficult at times, following some key practices make it a lot easier and more effective.

5. Video: Diversifying Your Network (bs_apd40_a02_enus_04)

Adding the right people to your network takes more than just introducing yourself. It takes effort. And so does diversifying your network, but it's worth doing it because the more diverse your network, the broader the perspectives, insights, and experiences it provides. In this video, you'll explore best practices for attracting new and diverse network connections.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Diversifying Your Network. [Video description ends]
A strong network isn't just about numbers. Strength also comes from range and diversity. And while diversifying your network isn't easy, it's worth doing – the more diverse your network, the broader the perspectives, insights, and experiences within it, and the broader the opportunities it will create for you. The mission to attract new and diverse network connections should begin with fostering a caring and sincere attitude.

This doesn't mean being overly intimate or great at small talk. It means having basic people skills and the right attitude. You demonstrate sincerity by listening actively, paying attention to what's being said, asking genuine questions, and sharing your own thoughts and experiences. Being caring and sincere is also about acknowledging, appreciating, and respecting the differences that come with diversity.

These things also help foster trust in your networking relationships, resulting in stronger engagement. Another way of diversifying your network is cultivating connections with people you haven't met yet. You can do this through your social networking profile and general online presence. Tweets, blog posts, and even volunteering for group assignments are all ways to showcase your skills and create a good first impression. Another way to cultivate such connections is through participation in conferences and networking events.

Engaging with someone face-to-face – even if it's just once – gives a new relationship a stronger foundation from which it can develop further and thrive. Reaching out to people with different backgrounds and experiences is another good strategy when looking to diversify your network. A more diverse network means a wider range of outlooks and skill sets, which means greater potential for learning and growth.

But how do you find more diverse connections? How do you connect with people who you wouldn't ordinarily encounter? One method is to look for connections across functions, geographies, and generations. This could be within or outside your own workplace. For example, you could reach out to juniors or young people in your organization or industry. Look for people with unique skills and experiences or trailblazers in unfamiliar areas. And the same goes for people with different – even opposing – opinions from yours. Ask questions and engage in thought-provoking exchanges so you better understand their positions. This diversification strengthens and enriches your network.

Bear in mind here that one of the great things about technology is it enables you to connect with people anywhere in the world. Finally, it's also a good practice to both find a mentor – or mentors – and be a mentor. When you're both a mentor and a mentee, you're reaching both up and down from your professional level. You're engaging with both senior and junior colleagues. That's diversity.

And remember that a mentor isn't necessarily someone you have a long-standing relationship with who guides you through your career. It could be someone who gives advice when you're making a difficult decision or who you can talk to when you're in a challenging situation. It's someone who supports you in difficult times, which is why it's important to have mentors in your circle of connections.

But you can have mentors who you've never even met or be a mentor to someone you've only spoken to or engaged with online or virtually. And, in fact, when the mentoring relationship is virtual, there's even more scope for expanding the diversity of your network. You're not limited to people within your own organization or your local area. There are no limits. Diversity brings a valuable dimension to a network. More diversity means more possibilities and more opportunities – which, after all, is what networking is all about.

6. Video: Building Rapport with New Network Contacts (bs_apd40_a02_enus_05)

If there's no affinity or mutual respect, your potential network contacts are unlikely to be of help in furthering your career. Remember that your contacts are also networking. You want them to talk favorably about you within their own circles. In this video, you'll identify strategies for building rapport with new network contacts.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Building Rapport with New Network Contacts. [Video description ends]
Building rapport with new contacts is critical to the success of your networking efforts. If you meet someone – whether face-to-face or online – for the first time and there's no affinity or mutual respect between you, they’re unlikely to be of active help in your career aspirations. Remember that your contacts are also networking. You want them to talk favorably about you within their own circles. But sometimes it can be difficult to know what to talk about or how to engage when you meet or connect with someone new. Fortunately, there are some helpful strategies for building rapport with new network contacts. To build rapport with a new contact – one who you don't know very well or may have only engaged with once or twice – reach out and interact virtually or online. While it's usually easier to develop rapport with someone face-to-face, it's not always possible or practical to meet in person, which is why virtual engagement is so important.

Actively participating in virtual conferences or events is one way to do this – and actively means making comments, contributing, and asking questions during online meetings or sessions. If the conference or event includes a chat feature, smaller breakout rooms, or more focused sessions, make the most of them. These can be a great opportunity for more personal, less formal interaction. Always keep your camera on so that others can put a face to the name and start to recognize you.

And don't be afraid to move things off social media. A phone call, a Zoom session, or a virtual coffee date can be a great way to take the relationship to the next level. While you're talking with a new contact, try to steer the conversation in the direction you want. Start with an impactful introduction. That’s the base for establishing a strong connection. And that's why it's important to have a strong online bio or profile or an opening pitch that grabs the attention of your new contact. Once you have their attention, the way you direct and orchestrate the conversation from there can vary depending upon your purpose.

But getting their attention is the first step in steering the conversation and building rapport. The idea is to kick start the conversation and get the other person engaged and interested in knowing more about you. First, your profile or pitch should be short. Don’t try to cover everything, just establish a starting point and pique their interest. Second, it should be specific and tailored, with your new audience and overall purpose in mind. Third, it should be authentic.

You're showcasing who you are, what you do, and why it matters. You could include a link to more detailed information about yourself or a blog if you have one. While it's OK to talk about your career goals or what you're hoping to achieve from your networking efforts, stop short of talking about your aspirations or ideals. Work to present yourself as someone the other person is pleased to have met and wants to know more about. Once you've begun to establish a rapport, you can open things up and move the conversation forward.

People love talking about themselves or blogs or posts they've written, so ask questions. When you ask people about themselves or an article they've just posted on social media, it makes them feel good, while you appear confident and interested. At least initially – and maybe even after that – you’ll want to avoid sensitive topics like politics or religion. Focus initially on business, careers, and mutually beneficial topics. You can also build rapport by learning about your contact's interests. The more connections you create with a new contact and the more you have in common, the more likely they'll become part of your active network.

One way to learn about your contact's interests is simply to observe them if you're meeting them in person or follow them online. Try to discern what stands out about them. What are they saying? What are they reading, doing, or wearing? Even if it seems the conversation is petering out, people often give clues about common interests as they speak. Perhaps you'll discover a shared passion or some coincidence that connects you. By pursuing these topics, the conversation gains momentum and flows naturally. For example, suppose you're talking to a new customer at her office and the conversation has stalled. But then you notice that she has a book you’re familiar with on her desk. You comment on the book.

It turns out you're both interested in similar topics and eager to discuss your favorite books. This common interest gives the conversation the pickup it needed. It might be a book, it might be a picture on the wall…it might be anything. The point is to actively seek out areas where you can connect. Or let's suppose your new contact is someone you interact with exclusively online. You can still observe this person by checking out their social media profile or reading through their online posts or comments. These give insight into a person's interests, hobbies, work history, and opinions.

Observing how your contact communicates on social media can help you understand their approach or style of communication, which can then be a useful clue as to how you should approach or communicate with them. Whatever direction the conversation takes or however long or short it is, make it memorable. Start by honing your communication skills. Some of these skills come into play before the conversation even begins.

For instance, a good attitude and being open, approachable, and welcoming to others makes a big difference. Pay attention to the other person, listening intently to what they're saying. Search for ways to help meet their needs and be of use to them. Suppose, for example, someone mentions during a virtual networking event that they're looking for an SEO expert to improve their website's visibility. You know people who could help. Tell your new contact – perhaps via a private message – that you'll pass on their information to the expert as soon as the event is over and see if they have any ideas to help solve their problem. This shows that you're interested in a mutually beneficial relationship and not just interested in what you can get from them. All of this is bolstered by maintaining good communication habits.

At its most fundamental level, this means being polite and displaying good manners in every interaction – no matter how busy or distracted you are. It also means following up and following through. Consider your new contact looking for an SEO expert. Don’t simply put it on your to-do list or forget about it. Instead, make sure to e-mail them the promised information. Reiterate that you enjoyed the conversation and would gladly help them again. This helps your new contact remember you and makes it more likely they’ll become an active member of your network. Adding new and more diverse contacts to your network is all well and good, but if these connections are to become meaningful, productive relationships, you need to build rapport with them.

While building a professional network is key to professional success, maintaining your network of existing contacts is just as important. Without committing to keeping your network healthy and thriving, your contacts will slowly forget that you exist. In this video, you will learn about strategies you can use to maintain your business network.

While building a professional network is key to professional success, maintaining your network of existing contacts is just as important. Without committing to keeping your network healthy and thriving, your contacts will slowly forget that you exist, and the support and help they provide will dissipate and eventually disappear. To prevent this, start by organizing your contacts. Collect them together in a single location. You can do this with a spreadsheet, an app, an online networking site, an e-mail tracking and tagging system, or whatever system works for you. Regardless of the system you use, be sure to record certain basic information – name, current job title and employer, industry, location, and contact details – as well as more specific information, such as interests, how you met, and who introduced you.

Remember, though, that people get promoted, switch jobs, or move industries all the time, and you’ll need to keep the information up to date and relevant. Next, go through the list and decide who you want to keep in touch with and how frequently you need to contact them. Make this part of your organizational system. One way is to add a scoring or ranking system. Think about putting contacts into groups depending on how often you want to keep in touch.

This makes it easier to schedule regular communication and follow-up. When you're ranking contacts, consider things like the strength of your relationship, the importance to you of the relationship, and each relationship's potential to help you achieve your goals. Staying in touch with your contacts is another important way to maintain your business network.

Depending upon location and other circumstances, this can be through e-mail, phone, face-to-face meetings, social gatherings, or social media posts. One of the best aspects of social media is that it enables you to stay in touch with any number of people no matter where they are. Be sure to check in with connections regularly, even if it's just to say hello or ask for an update. If your connection needs assistance, offer support or help them with whatever challenges they're facing.

Try to meet as often as possible. You can also stay in touch with contacts through virtual meetings. These are especially useful for reaching out to people spread out across the country or the globe. For instance, you could organize a virtual or online meeting to bring like-minded people together regardless of their location. However, use your judgment. While proactively reaching out can be a powerful way to build professional relationships, don't force things or be overzealous in scheduling events or contacts.

Take others’ schedules and needs into consideration. Similarly, be sure you're being generous with your contacts. If you're always asking for favors from people in your network but never giving any in return, you'll soon find that your contacts will dry up. One-way relationships destroy networks. The golden rule of networking is to always give more than you receive. You can find many ways to do this, even if it's not possible to meet face-to-face. For example, you could offer your availability for a virtual meeting if a contact needs help or advice.

Even just commenting on or liking a contact's social media post is a way of being generous. Don't worry if a contact doesn't respond in the same way as often, or seem appreciative. Over time, being generous will pay off. You could also consider forming a networking group with like-minded contacts. You know the level of activity and sense of community that groups in social media can generate.

These groups keep members informed and up to date on what's happening in a particular area of interest, while also enabling members to participate when another member has a question or needs assistance. Forming a networking group with like-minded contacts is building a similar kind of community.

It's a focused group where members keep in touch, share ideas, collaborate, encourage one another, and most of all, help one another. You can't just build a business network and leave it at that. A network needs attention and nurturing. Like a garden, it needs to be maintained. Otherwise, it risks withering away.

6.
When speaking with a new contact, look for ways to help meet their needs
Feedback:
Option 1:
This option is correct. Learning about your contact's interests is an effective strategy for building rapport. One way to learn about your contact's interests is simply to observe them or follow them online. What are they saying, reading, or doing?
Option 2:
This option is incorrect. When trying to build rapport with a new contact, one approach is to make your communication memorable. This means being open, approachable, and welcoming, and also listening with interest to what the other person is saying. You should not try to dominate the conversation.
Option 3:
This option is correct. One strategy for building rapport with new network contacts is to steer the conversation in the direction you want, which starts with making an impactful introduction. A good opening pitch is one that grabs the attention of your new contact; the idea is to kick-start the conversation and get the other person interested in knowing more about you.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. A strategy for building rapport is to learn about your contact's interests. One way to do this is to observe your contact and look for clues about any common interests in what they say or what they're wearing, doing, or reading.
Option 5:
This option is correct. To build rapport with a new contact – one who you don't know very well or may have only engaged with once or twice – you can reach out and interact virtually or online. While it's usually easier to develop rapport with someone face-to-face, it's not always possible or practical to meet in person, which is why virtual engagement is so important. Actively participating in virtual conferences or events is one way to do this.
Option 6:
This option is correct. An important strategy for building rapport with new network contacts is to make your communication memorable. One way to do this is to look for ways to contribute or be of some service, such as referring them to an existing contact who has a skill or service they require.

B.
You send a “check-in” e-mail to a contact to say hello and ask for an update
C.
You collate your contacts in a single spreadsheet and enter contact and profile information alongside each name
D.

Make sure to stay in touch
2.
Be generous with your contacts
3.
Organize your contacts
4.
Form a networking group with like-minded contacts
Answer
1:
Option B
2:
Option A
3:
Option C
4:
Option D
Feedback:
Target 1:
Staying in touch is an important strategy in maintaining your business network. Simply contacting members of your network – whether by phone, e-mail, social media posts, or any other way – to check in, say hello, or ask for updates is how you stay in touch.
Target 2:
Being generous with your contacts is a key strategy when it comes to maintaining your business network. If you're always asking for favors but never giving any in return, you'll find that your contacts dry up quickly, so the golden rule of networking is to always give more than you receive.
Target 3:
An important strategy for maintaining your business network is to organize your contacts, which begins with collecting them together in a single location, such as a spreadsheet, app, or online networking site. You should include information such as name, job title, current employer, industry, location, and contact details.
Target 4:
An important strategy for maintaining your business network is to form a networking group with like-minded contacts. These groups can be online or virtual and can be highly effective at generating a strong sense of community. Members can keep in touch, share ideas, collaborate, and encourage and help one another.
