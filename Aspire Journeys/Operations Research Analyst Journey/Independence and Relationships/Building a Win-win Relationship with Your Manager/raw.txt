You and your manager were both hired to do a job. While you sit at different levels of your company’s organization chart, in fact, your jobs are entwined.

You and your manager were both hired to do a job. While you sit at different levels of your company’s organization chart, in fact, your jobs are entwined. Success or failure for one means the same for the other. To succeed, you must be able to work productively together. Numerous studies have shown that your levels of happiness, engagement, stress, and commitment in the workplace are strongly linked to your relationship with your manager. In fact, a Harvard Business School survey of almost 20,000 employees showed that people who felt respected by their managers had better health, better psychological well-being, and greater job satisfaction.

But it’s not just the employee who benefits. While you need your manager for direction, resources, timing, and prioritization, your manager needs you for your knowledge, skills, and experience. In a healthy working relationship, you deliver on your commitments and your manager delivers on theirs. This is a win for everyone. By the same measure, unhealthy working relationships cost the employee, the manager, and the organization. Missed deadlines, inefficient use of resources, and high employee turnover negatively affect people up and down the organizational chart. On a more personal level, a poor working relationship with your manager increases stress and conflict.

It means more rework, extra effort expended, and a higher likelihood of poor performance reviews. There’s clearly a lot at stake. But taking a good, long look at your working relationship with your manager has a few benefits will allow you to develop the relationship into one of mutually beneficial interdependence. You can’t leave it up to your manager to build such an important relationship alone or blame your manager for your own lack of effort.

Fair or not, you’re responsible for taking charge of your career and the factors that affect it. This means breaking down the relationship into its component parts and looking at the areas involved that allow you to have a positive impact on those issues at stake. Your role in the relationship is to accept and clarify tasks and assignments, and then provide your manager with results.

Their role is to make sure you’re prepared and supported as much as necessary to succeed. For both of you to do your jobs well and produce satisfactory results, a healthy working relationship with open and honest communication is a must.

Always keep it in mind that you and your managers’ interests are aligned. You both want to succeed. It takes working together to get there. Understanding this interdependence, then, means you can take action to claim, or reclaim, the ownership of your manager-report relationship. If you are ultimately the person accountable for your career decisions, logically, the next step is thinking about what you can do to improve the working relationship with your manager.

Is your own communication open and honest? Do you seek clarification when you’re unsure of what’s expected of you? If something seems like an unreasonable request, do you bring it up to your manager, or simply accept it and get resentful about it? Consider a team member who always completes their work on time and at a high standard. Yet their manager finds their overall performance lacking. After several frustrating months, they finally go to their manager for an explanation.

It turns out that the manager expects more detail in the employee’s reports and considers them imprecise. The employee had always assumed that a more granular level of detail was unnecessary. The problem with this worker-manager relationship is a lack of communication.

Instead of asking, the employee kept making the same mistake over and over, becoming increasingly frustrated with the manager. Instead of taking the time to clarify what they expected, the manager has continued to be disappointed and become increasingly frustrated with the employee. Together, they've created a lose-lose scenario and a poor working relationship. But by carefully examining your own relationship with your manager, you can take action to reclaim it and develop it into a healthy, mutually beneficial partnership. You’ll both be better off for it.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Getting to Know Your Manager's Work Style. [Video description ends]
Building a good working relationship with your manager starts with getting to know their work style. You need to know how they work so that you can comfortably align your own working style. This doesn’t mean fundamentally changing who you are. It simply means understanding your manager’s cues and responding in kind. This is part of building a mutually beneficial working relationship. To thrive in your current position, you must make the effort to understand your manager and periodically adjust your behaviors and communication, as necessary, to work productively with them.

To understand your manager’s way of working, it’s helpful to begin by looking at a couple of core personality traits that drive social behaviors. Extroversion and introversion are personality characteristics at two ends of a continuum. While most people fall somewhere toward the middle with leanings to one end or the other, these characteristics can have an impact on your manager’s way of communicating and acting.

Extroverts are often more outspoken and ready to share information. They’re quick to action, they flourish in the company of others, and their personalities often seem large and directed outward. Introverts, on the other hand, are less inclined to openly share information, and then often only minimally. They tend to think long and hard before acting. They frequently prefer to work alone, finding that solitude refuels them. Their personality generally comes across to others as self-contained and focused inward.

Personality traits – whether introverted, extroverted, or anywhere in between – drive and shape the behaviors that your manager tends to use when interacting with others. Think for a moment about where you fall on the extrovert/introvert continuum, especially in relation to your manager. Whether your personality is similar to or quite different from theirs, it can color your relationship with them. In addition to these behavioral drivers, and heavily influenced by them, everyone also has their own work style.

It may be helpful to think of your manager’s work style as being their operating system and you need to learn the programming language. But though personalities can vary widely, there are four basic, common work styles. Your manager, of course, may display traits that fall under more than one broad category. But these can serve as basic guideposts for how to best adapt your own behaviors to work successfully with your manager.

Let’s begin with the extroverts, starting with the achiever. Achievers like to be in charge. They are highly focused on tasks and goal orientated. They seek to control their environments and are fueled by winning and achieving results.

To effectively manage your relationship with an Achiever, you need to be clear and show your competence. You please an achiever by achieving, going beyond simply checking boxes and completing tasks. It means producing measurable results. If you don’t fully understand what’s expected, ask for clarification.

Share regular updates to show your progress and commitment. And if you disagree or have a better idea for getting the job done, be prepared to explain exactly why and how your way will benefit them. The motivator, on the other hand, is a “people” person, full of enthusiasm, positive energy, and outgoing personality.

They have an aptitude for involving and motivating others by selling their ideas and making everyone feel like an essential part of the team. They are persuasive, sometimes impulsive, and generally creative risk takers. To work well with a motivator, show your creative, collaborative, and enthusiastic sides.

Listen carefully to their ideas and share suggestions about how to realize them. And since motivators can be unrealistic and undisciplined at times, ask for clarity and avoid committing to doing something you don’t fully understand. On the more introverted side of the continuum, the assessor is a methodical and process-orientated person who wants all the information before making a decision.

They are persistent, moderate-paced workers who value precision, accuracy, and quality. Task-focused as opposed to people-focused, they have great respect for data, rules, and procedures.

To foster a productive relationship with an assessor, focus on hitting your goals and come to meetings well prepared with metrics, statistics, and progress trackers. Push them for the specific details of what they want from you. Work with them to set reasonable, achievable, and succinct goals.

In general, keep your feelings and opinions to yourself. If you want their attention, bring the facts. Finally, the unifier values people, personal relationships, and harmony. They are cooperative team builders who want you to be successful and happy.

They believe in getting everyone on board and seeking agreement by mediating between different approaches and opinions. Typically, they’re careful decision makers who work at a moderate pace. They are generally honest, respectful, supportive, and dependable.

They tend to respect and respond best to others who share a similar attitude. To work best with a unifier, be honest and open about your issues. They’re good listeners.

Acknowledge and show you’ve learned from your mistakes. They appreciate your growth. Take steps to build strong relationships with your colleagues, as they consider this important. Give your honest opinion and accept honest feedback. It’s important to reiterate that adapting to your manager's work style doesn’t mean fundamentally changing who you are or subverting your own personality. You’re not looking for a buddy; you’re looking for an ally. And a healthy, mutually beneficial working relationship with your manager requires effort, adjustment, and sometimes adaptation.

5. Video: Communicating Effectively with Your Manager (bs_apd40_a03_enus_04)

Communication doesn't always flow smoothly. It’s easy for managers and their team members to talk over, under, and past each other. Everyone thinks they understand, but really, no one does. Miscommunication is perhaps the most common cause of failure in building productive employee-manager relationships. In this video, you will learn about the types of questions you can ask to help you align your communication style with your manager’s.

recognize questions you can ask to help you align your communication style with your manager’s
[Video description begins] Topic title: Communicating Effectively with Your Manager. [Video description ends]
Ideally, your manager tells you what they want from you. You tell them what you need from them to provide it. You work together, from your respective places in the hierarchy, and come to an agreement about what will happen and how, utilizing clear and open communication. Ideally. But communication isn’t always ideal. It’s easy for managers and their team members to talk over, under, and past each other.

Everyone thinks they understand, but really, no one does. Miscommunication is perhaps the most common cause of failure in building productive employee-manager relationships. And clashing or misaligned communication styles are the major cause of miscommunication. As the employee, it’s part of your job to recognize your manager’s communication style and find ways to align with it.

The challenge of clear communication can be increased by working in virtual teams or working with a new manager. Making a conscious effort and taking a flexible approach to effective communication are essential. For example, when you start working with a new manager, you can’t assume their communication preferences are the same as yours. Nor can you assume that their style is the same as other managers you’ve worked with in the past.

With each individual working relationship, you need to know how and when to communicate with your manager to get the best results. To illustrate, suppose you’re on a project that requires you to report to two different managers. One is generally slow to respond to e-mails, preferring a phone call or face-to-face conversation to discuss issues and settle them quickly. The other manager likes to be left alone but is fast in responding to e-mails and instant messages.

The same adaptive communication strategy won’t work with both managers. Each needs a personalized, individual approach. To find the right approach for communicating with your manager, you need to understand their communication style and preferences. In most cases, you’ll be able to figure it out through experience and careful observation, but it’s also fair and appropriate to simply ask them.

Start by asking your manager how they prefer to communicate. What mode, or method, are they most comfortable with? E-mail, phone, instant messages, or in person? Then ask when they want to be contacted. What frequency do they prefer – daily reports, weekly reports, or is it OK just to come to them, ad hoc, whenever a problem arises?

If you’re working remotely with them, say across time zones, it’s important to discuss what times you’re both available and online. If a problem arises at night or on the weekend, is it OK to make a contact? And this means you also need to know what types of issues your manager wants to know about.

Do they want to be included on all team e-mails or just specific threads? What type of information do they want to see? Progress reports? Risks? Budgeting issues?

And, further, how much or what level of detail do they actually want? Are they looking for the granular details or just the overall picture of the matter at hand? Communication is the hinge on which working relationships swing. Keeping your manager informed about progress, challenges, and risks is an important part of the job. Every manager is different and finding out what they want and how best to do it is a key to building a stronger working relationship with yours.

Tuning into their style and preferences leads to a higher level of engagement and quicker response times. It will eliminate a lot of potential frustration for both of you.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Dealing with Conflict and Micromanagement. [Video description ends]
Relationships can be tricky things to navigate. Personal or professional, they constantly evolve and change, requiring attention, adjustment, and compromise. So, you can expect that even the most solid and mutually beneficial manager-employee relationships are going to experience conflicts and challenges from time to time. These challenges can be stressful and affect your productivity, especially if they’re allowed to escalate. The best way to keep that from happening is to acknowledge them and face them head on. Suppose you’ve gotten a negative response to a project deliverable and you’re angry. And now you feel like your manager is looking over your shoulder and having second thoughts about your project assignments.

Your first move should involve holding a frank but calm conversation with your manager to find out exactly what’s gone wrong or why you disagree with their assessment. Whatever the challenge, take the time to calm down, organize your thoughts, and prepare for the conversation. This preparation includes picking the right moment to have the conversation in the first place. Ideally, personal issues and work challenges are dealt with in regular sessions that provide an opportunity for open discussion. But if not, choose and confirm a convenient time with your manager and gather the facts and data you need to support your viewpoint. This might include your daily records, progress reports, e-mails, or any other documents to use as evidence to make your case. Before the meeting, make sure to check yourself for unreasonable expectations. Ask yourself honestly if your situation is the result of poor communication and false assumptions on your part.

Is your argument based on facts and real evidence? And you must be willing to accept responsibility and acknowledge your own role in the problem. During the conversation, be ready to listen and employ your emotional intelligence. This means being aware of emotional responses and reactions your own and your manager's. Are they open and receptive? Are they defensive or hurt? Are they angry? Happy to have an opportunity to get on the same page? Somewhere in the middle? Recognizing the emotional component of the conversation is important. This, and adopting a "listen first" approach, can then help you find resolution and prevent the conflict from escalating.

Listening attentively and respectfully before you speak helps avoid further misunderstanding. You can adjust your response accordingly before you proceed. Being tuned in and aware of other people’s feelings can be the difference between causing hurt and making the problem worse and finding mutual resolution and strengthening your relationship. When you do respond, make it about you. Use "I" statements whenever possible. It’s the difference between, “I find it difficult to understand the instructions,” which keeps the focus on your needs, as opposed to, “Your instructions are unclear,” which assigns blame. Assigning blame makes people defensive. Remember, you’re looking for resolution, not vindication.

If you find yourself getting worked up, stop, and take a deep breath to calm down. Ask for a short break if necessary. Then, get your emotions under control and focus on the facts at hand. Reaching agreement based on the facts at issue makes it easier to reach a mutual, workable solution. Ultimately, the facts are what lead to find a lasting resolution, allowing you to get to the root cause of the conflict. Sometimes it's useful to work backward, retracing the symptoms of the problem in order to get at what’s caused it in the first place. However you proceed, finding the exact cause of the issue lets you and your manager troubleshoot solutions. Achieving a mutual understanding of the issue makes it much easier to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution.

Bear in mind that a lack of mutual understanding is often at the center of conflict. Many disputes center around managers’ expectations, and misunderstandings often lead to micromanagement. Micromanagement is born out of a manager’s need for control. The tendency to micromanage can come from many sources, but often it's simple miscommunication. The manager has expectations, and the employee, for whatever reason, doesn’t fulfill them. Maybe the expectations weren’t clear. Maybe they weren’t reasonable. In either case, it can breed mistrust and that leads to micromanaging. And trust is essential to a healthy relationship with your manager. You can build, or rebuild, that trust during conflict resolution by being honest about where you feel communications and expectations have broken down. You need to own your end of the breakdown and ask for both what you need from your manager to move forward, and what they need from you. And then commit to it. With a renewed trust born of open, honest communication about the conflict, you can work together toward a final win-win solution. Any time more than one person is involved, conflict will eventually follow. When you build trust with your manager, you create an environment in which you can both work through conflict and challenge, compromising and adapting as necessary.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Optimizing the Collaboration with Your Manager. [Video description ends]
You and your manager are involved in a collaborative partnership. It is, of course, an unequal partnership, but a partnership nonetheless. But for this collaboration to be successful long-term, it needs to be nourished and maintained. And for that, you need to be proactive and employ some best practices for growing and optimizing the relationship. You can start by building on your manager’s strengths and compensating for areas where you know they sometimes struggle. Paying attention and getting to know what your manager does well and helping them maximize the outcome of their efforts is essential for maintaining a healthy relationship. For example, if your manager is a motivator, get behind their decisions and help sell them to the doubters on the team. Be upbeat and help convert any naysayers. By the same logic, if your manager struggles with both leading meetings and taking notes and recapping key points during meetings, offer to do it for them. You’ll be doing your manager, yourself, and the team a favor.

Remember, when your manager succeeds, this is a win for both of you, and the organization too. Another proactive practice is to anticipate your manager’s needs. For any given project, you’re likely to have a more detailed view of the specific tasks you’re working on. You’re closer to the ground. Give your manager regular updates on project developments and bring any risks you see on the horizon to their attention immediately. And when you can, accompany the warning with any solutions and workarounds you may think of to mitigate the risk. Consider, too, that managers often don’t have enough time to fully prepare for every meeting and check-in. Look for ways to contribute to their goals by aligning your own priorities to help meet them. Suppose your manager asks you to help with a presentation they’re giving for a department quarterly review. They’re pressed for time and ask you to help out with some of the details. Looking closely at the presentation, you see it’s organized haphazardly and visually dull. Here is an opportunity to go above and beyond for them. Maybe you can do some reorganizing and add some appropriate graphics.

Optimizing your collaboration with your manager is worth the effort. By strengthening the presentation, with your manager’s OK, you’ve taken an opportunity to contribute to meeting their goals by aligning them with your own priorities. When they look good, it helps you look good to them. It helps to keep in mind that your manager has both a public agenda with one set of priorities, and a personal agenda with another. The public agenda relates to the business strategies set out by the company for your manager to implement. These are meant to meet organizational goals that you and your team are working toward. Think about the structure of your organization and where both you and your manager fit into it. Consider, then, how your actions can help your manager reach these public goals. Learn your manager’s deadlines and deliverables, and then ensure they get what they need from you with as much time to spare as possible. But like everyone, your manager also has unstated personal goals. Observe and ask questions to help you figure out what your manager cares about most. Is work-life balance important to them? Are they after a promotion? Do they care about your team’s morale? When you know what matters most to them, you can help them achieve it. This deepens your relationship by aligning your priorities with your manager’s. Building and maintaining a healthy working relationship with your manager is a win-win. Your manager gets a dependable team member they can trust and rely on. You get an ally who can make your working life more satisfying, successful, and enjoyable.

Identifying the root cause of the conflict
Feedback:
Option 1:
This option is correct. If you find yourself becoming emotional when discussing the problem or conflict, stop and take a deep breath to calm down. Ask for a short break if necessary. Then, get your emotions under control and focus on the facts at hand. Reaching agreement based on the facts makes it easier to reach a mutual, workable solution.
Option 2:
This option is correct. Preparing for the conversation includes organizing your thoughts, gathering the facts, and checking yourself for unreasonable expectations. Ideally, issues can be dealt with in regular sessions with open discussion, but if a special meeting is needed, choose and confirm a convenient time and gather the facts and data to support your viewpoint.
Option 3:
This option is correct. Being aware of your manager's emotional responses and reactions will help you to avoid causing hurt and making the problem worse. Adopting a "listen first" approach can help prevent the conflict from escalating.
Option 4:
This option is correct. It's important to be honest about where you feel communications and expectations have broken down, and to own your end of the breakdown.
Option 5:
This option is incorrect. Your manager does not necessarily need to know how you feel. The focus of the conversation should be the facts.
Option 6:
This option is correct. Achieving a mutual understanding of the cause of the issue makes it easier to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution. Work backward to retrace the symptoms of the problem back to the cause.
Option 7:
This option is incorrect. It's important to choose the right moment to have the conversation, even if that means waiting.
