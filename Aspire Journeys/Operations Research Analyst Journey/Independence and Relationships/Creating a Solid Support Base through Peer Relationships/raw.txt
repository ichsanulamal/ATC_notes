At work, as in private life, your peers can provide an invaluable variety of experiences, expertise, and institutional knowledge. In fact, your career success is often dependent on how well you develop supportive peer relationships. You probably know your peers already: their names, their roles and titles, and their work. But within your peer network, you may rely more on peers who have certain skills, or a lot of job experience, that can help you along your career path.

Let’s explore a few key peer relationships in greater detail. Experts, or specialists, are employees with special expertise who can help you achieve your objectives. In that way, they are your allies. They aren’t overly competitive, but they do enjoy being on the cutting edge of things.

While they may not work within your immediate group, they can set an example that’s inspirational to others. People often achieve their work goals by forging professional bonds with others. Mentors are the senior peers willing and able to guide you toward achieving long-term goals. Experienced mentors take an active role in fostering the advancement of the mentee, providing advice and the benefits of their experience.

Influencers play a vital role in many organizations. These are individuals who champion new technology, innovative practices, and improved practices and standards. They typically have a high level of networking skills and represent the connective tissue between people and departments. As change agents, they project positivity and enthusiasm.

Your most emotionally rewarding key peer relationships are with your friends. Friends in your peer group are coworkers with whom you have a relationship that transcends work. To move past simply "getting along" with your peers requires a shared wish to move to the next level. This involves a willingness to develop the relationship to include experiences outside of work, and the sufficient trust to discuss issues that require discretion.

Think about the role peers play in your day-to-day working life. For example, let’s consider an employee, Sofia, who is upset about her most recent performance feedback. She considers herself dedicated and hard-working, but the feedback she received indicates she is underperforming. She genuinely wants to move ahead in her career and decides to ask her peers for help.

The expert or specialist in her peer group can set an example that will inspire her to achieve her full potential. Sofia may even be sufficiently inspired to work toward becoming a specialist herself, and start building stronger relationships as a leader of others. The mentor in her peer group can take an active role in helping her improve her performance and achieve her goals. They will use their experience to guide Sofia forward with confidence.

The influencer in her peer group, as a skilled networker, can share trends and movements within the business and keep Sofia informed on what’s happening in the big picture. They will provide positive, useful information that can help Sofia achieve the success she desires. Finally, her peer group friend will provide emotional and professional support.

A sense of connection with friends can help Sofia feel happier and more engaged at work. She’ll experience a more positive inner work life, ultimately leading to stronger workplace motivation. Regardless of your personal situation, developing and maintaining strong relationships with peers at work can have a significant and valuable effect on your personal happiness and professional performance.

Peers are an invaluable source of information. They act as the cornerstone of your support system, providing both social and professional support. In this video, you'll explore the benefits of having a peer support system at work.

[Video description begins] Topic title: How Peers Support Each Other. [Video description ends]
Peers are an invaluable source of information. They act as the cornerstone of your support system, providing both social and professional support. Imagine it’s your first day in a new role. You’ve landed your dream job, and you will be managing a talented team. You’re qualified, you’re enthusiastic, you’re ready to get to work. But to be effective, you’ve still got a lot to learn. There are practical, business-related issues to begin to understand. What’s the status of the current projects? What are the policies around managing client contracts? Who approves vacation time? Who keeps track of workplace health and safety? These questions explore the official, tangible policy and procedural aspects of your new role.

But then there are the unwritten rules, the intangibles that shape a workplace. What are the office politics? How happy is your team? Who is competitive, and who are the team players? When does the workday really end? Should you keep your office door open or closed?

Who buys the doughnuts? The answers to both sets of questions, which form the formal and informal rules of the workplace, will come from your peers. Whether you’re a new hire or a company veteran, you will derive benefits from developing strong peer relationships. Be proactive when cultivating and maintaining a peer network and see where it takes you. For example, asking for performance feedback from someone in a senior position may be the first step toward acquiring a valuable mentor and a relationship that could be a huge boost to your career.

There’s no question that strong peer relationships are valuable for many reasons, but let’s go through four key benefits in detail. First, peer relationships facilitate goal achievement. By tapping into the experience of coworkers and senior colleagues, you can learn valuable new skills. Peers help you get work done by providing practical or technical advice or introducing you to others who can help.

They can also illuminate those important unwritten workplace rules that aren’t covered by formal processes and systems. A second benefit is that peer support systems give you help when you need it. Building strong, mutually beneficial peer relationships aligns you with people who share a common cause. Whether your peers have more seniority in the same role as you or are at your experience level in a different role, the point is that you have something in common.

Working toward this shared or overarching goal presents a terrific learning opportunity for both parties. The third benefit of strong relationships is that peers who act as mentors can aid career advancement by providing vital psychosocial support. Any time a peer offers you day-to-day assistance, advice, or protection, this is psychosocial support.

It could be something as simple as alerting you to the boss’s bad mood before going into a meeting. The important thing is that your peer is acting in your best interest. Psychosocial support helps develop your competence, professional identity, and self-worth.

Mentor peers can also aid your career advancement by providing challenging assignments, sponsoring promotions, and advising you in high-risk situations. The fourth peer relationship benefit is that healthy social interactions with peers create a more enjoyable workplace.

When you maintain strong peer relationships, you are better equipped to cope with stress and thrive during times of change. There is someone on hand to listen to your concerns, to empathize, to provide counsel when required. With peers offering social support, you are more likely to feel connected and valued in your role. Whether it’s your first day on the job or simply a day that’s more challenging than usual, a peer support network is vital. From personal and professional advice to proactively helping your career advancement, your peers are your allies on the road to success.

5. Video: Adapting to Varied Peer Work Styles (bs_apd40_a01_enus_04)

To fully leverage the power of peer relationships, you must first identify the personality types around you. By adapting to their various work styles, you can work more effectively with a diverse group of people. In this video, you will learn to recognize ways to adjust to various work styles of peers.

recognize ways to adjust to various work styles of peers
[Video description begins] Topic title: Adapting to Varied Peer Work Styles. [Video description ends]
Celebrating diversity and individuality is a wonderful thing. It reminds us that we’re all unique and everyone has their own style of doing things. But it also reminds us that we need to learn to work together if we want to get things accomplished. How can you recognize and adjust to the various work styles of your peers? By examining some common peer types – purists, team players, and individualists – you gain insight into how to work with them. Purists are the least political of all employees and will respond best to peers who simply focus on the work at hand. They take the “straight ahead” approach and view hard work as the main method for achieving goals.

They tend to follow rules and actively avoid conflict. Their “steady on” nature means they say what they mean and tend to tell the truth, even if it reflects negatively on them. Their trusting nature can sometimes border on naivety. The purist may take on extra work, for example, to avoid the potential conflict caused by saying “no.” To work effectively with a purist, approach them in a straightforward way that mirrors their work style.

Purists are often the first to arrive at the office and the last to leave, and their work is always up to standard. Respect this work ethic, but don’t take advantage of it. Since purists are best suited to minimally politicized environments, avoid involving them in political office maneuvers or efforts to exert influence.

Remember, purists favor working hard for what is “fair” and “right.” Present them with situations that have clear rules, as well as goals that are achievable through hard work and you’ll lay the groundwork for a mutually beneficial peer relationship. Team players are distinguishable by their willingness to work toward achieving team goals. Like purists, a team player’s preference is to abide by formal rules.

However, they are also willing to use political maneuvering to achieve those team goals. In this sense, they are the opposite of purists. They may respect the rules, but they recognize that “fair” and “right” are often ambiguous. They are comfortable using their connections and influence for the good of the team and find professional satisfaction in fostering collaboration.

When working with a team player, remember that they thrive in moderately political environments. Be prepared to indulge this political leaning. Their interest, first and foremost, is in the team. To benefit from this peer relationship, it is therefore important to rally team players to your cause.

Accept that they are willing to go the extra mile, and even as far as bending the rules, to help you achieve a team goal. While purists and team players may approach office politics differently, they are still able to work together. Office politics aren’t always a bad thing, and the purist can even benefit from the team player’s political maneuvers.

For example, when the team player highlights the purist’s hard work to improve the team’s visibility, the purist and the team player are engaged in a mutually beneficial relationship. Individualists, on the other hand, will mostly collaborate if there is an opportunity for personal gain. They are generally the most political employees.

They’ll follow the rules and maintain peer relationships when it will result in personal advancement. Unlike the purist, individualists are generally distrustful of others’ motives. When working with the individualist, remember that they thrive in highly political environments. They gravitate to positions of power and opportunities for personal gain.

To work effectively with individualist peers, guide them toward associating their personal goal with a team goal. Individualists are often influential, and ready to push ahead using political means if required. But they can be a useful ally if their path and yours are headed in the same direction.

In work as in life, it’s sometimes better to be flexible in how you approach the people and situations around you. You may be a purist in a roomful of individualists, for example, but that doesn’t mean you can’t learn to work together. By identifying and adjusting to the preferred work styles of your peers, you have a much higher chance of achieving your goals.

6. Video: Embracing Your Peers' Differences (bs_apd40_a01_enus_05)

While diversity can sometimes pose challenges when communicating and coordinating meetings and schedules in the workplace, it is also an opportunity to make life, and work, significantly richer. In this video, you will explore strategies for embracing the unique talents of your peers.

recognize strategies to embrace the unique talents of your peers
[Video description begins] Topic title: Embracing Your Peers' Differences. [Video description ends]
Today’s workplaces are more diverse than ever, with gender, age, ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity now the norm. Some of your coworkers likely live and work in another city or country. While this diversity can sometimes pose challenges when communicating and coordinating meetings and schedules in the workplace, it is also an opportunity to make life, and work, significantly richer. The same holds for diversity within your peer relationships. Embracing diversity in the peer environment encourages thinking, learning, and new perspectives. Diverse peers may offer unique views and solutions, which in turn broadens your way of perceiving problems. Similarly, diversity among your mentors can help you gain access to other peer networks, along with the associated learning, support, mentoring, and expertise opportunities.

However, we all have unconscious attitudes that can negatively affect our peer interactions. These are involuntary, unintentional biases that can be barriers to overcoming stereotypes, developing trust, and managing perceptions of others. Overcoming these attitudes requires suspending judgment and taking steps to embrace your peers’ differences.

Like in any relationship, empathy, open dialogue, and a willingness to risk discomfort are important. Adjusting to different communication styles is also essential. Consider the broad range of opposing communication styles in a diverse group – direct versus indirect, expressive versus restrained, and so on. Even the difference in casual expressions and cultural references of different generations can put up walls.

While no single communication style is “correct,” the convergence of opposing styles can be problematic. For example, if you favor indirect communication, a team member with a blunt or direct style may not perceive the nuance of what you're saying. Similarly, mitigated speech – which softens the impact of a message, request, or problem – can lead to confused communication between diverse groups. Consider that research has shown that the simple phrase “I’m sorry” is frequently deployed in different ways in different cultures, and even between men and women in some contexts.

As a result, it’s important to explore strategies to help you embrace diverse peers. First, befriend your peers by identifying common interests and values. Cross-cultural communication can be improved by stating that you are interested in learning from your peers.

This simple communication tool, along with the discovery of shared interests, is a great step toward building positive peer communication. Next, make an extra effort to help your peers, and to learn from them. This is particularly helpful if you are the senior party since it shows a willingness to work with and for your peers. What’s more, it provides an opportunity to communicate your preferred work style.

Clear language is essential when communicating with a culturally diverse group. Even when sharing a common first language, bear in mind that idioms, colloquialisms, and jargon can get lost in translation when crossing cultural borders. Keep your language clear, concise, and straightforward. Reflective listening, or paraphrasing, is another useful tactic.

By paraphrasing a message back to the speaker, you can eliminate any potential misunderstanding. The same tactic applies to written communication. If you don’t fully understand the language used, paraphrase the message in your reply to ensure you have grasped the intended meaning. Adapting to working with multiple generations can create further issues.

For example, company hierarchy was once predicated on age, with senior staff generally older than the teams they managed. But with today’s diverse hiring practices, organizations are just as likely to promote a 30-year-old to manage a team of older workers. What’s more, different generations working at the same organizational level may have different work styles.

For example, a young customer service agent may be more comfortable with technology than an older counterpart, which could lead to greater efficiency when the younger worker is accessing customer details. But they may also lean on or occasionally seem distracted by technology in customer-facing situations, which may contrast with some older agents who prefer a more conversational style.

The key to overcoming these issues is to recognize each other’s strengths and how they can work together effectively. Consider again the example of the customer service agents.

They both share a common goal, which is efficient and excellent customer service. Neither group is entirely correct in their approach, but by addressing the issue, each can come to appreciate the benefits of learning from each other.

In this instance, the younger workers’ performance might benefit from a more conversational style, while the older workers could up their efficiency by learning more nimble use of technology in customer encounters. What’s important to note is that you can effectively decrease the gap in your peer groups when you are willing to learn from others.

Similarly, by adapting your communication style and embracing differences, you can bridge many diversity gaps among your peers and learn to benefit from the unique talents each individual has to offer.

7. Video: Building Better Strategic Peer Relationships (bs_apd40_a01_enus_06)

Peer relationships are important to professional success. Building and sustaining them, however, means paying attention and expending effort. In this video, you will identify techniques for fostering strategic relationships with peers.

[Video description begins] Topic title: Building Better Strategic Peer Relationships. [Video description ends]
With key peers on your side, it’s important to work hard to maintain those relationships. Getting a promotion, for instance, doesn’t mean you can move on and ignore your former peers. Your relationships will suffer, and you’ll have to work very hard to regain people’s trust. Relationships are best maintained when you nurture them. Building strong, strategic peer relationships requires employing some proven techniques. One technique is to demonstrate your emotional intelligence.

This is the skill of monitoring and controlling your feelings and being sensitive to the feelings of others. In conversation, listen and pay attention to what the other person is saying. Don’t allow yourself to be distracted and disengaged when talking with your peers. On the contrary, displaying curiosity and asking follow-up questions shows sincerity of intent and gains others’ trust. Strategic peer relationships are built on mutual trust and balance.

Don’t jump in, unasked, to try to solve everyone’s problems. This will simply make you the person who takes on the office’s unwanted or problematic tasks. Instead, work with your peers to turn problems into cooperative, beneficial, and constructive experiences. This is a sign of emotional intelligence, and an essential ingredient for building and maintaining strategic relationships. Another way to foster relationships with peers is through collaboration. Where possible, collaborate with mentors to gain new skills as well as connections to other people who, in turn, may provide you with additional advice or skills.

It’s important, of course, that you can deliver on your commitments. Don’t over-promise, and make sure you understand the business issues you’re collaborating on. Collaboration also leads directly to helping peers with their goals. If you have specialized skills in a particular area, people may welcome your help and be willing to help you in return.

It’s important to be there for your peers, sharing your resources and connections. Peer coaching, for example, allows employees to spend time in pairs, speaking about their challenges, fears, and hopes. These relationships will be stronger if you create time in your day to interact with your colleagues.

Turn up to meetings a few minutes early or check in with colleagues at the end of the day. These informal moments are the interactions that help build strategic relationships. Better yet, find specific times for casual meetings. When building relationships with collocated peers, for example, consider going to lunch together, organizing a picnic, or even hosting a party. Of course, you won’t always be collocated with your peers. Most corporate organizations are made up of hybrid groups of collocated peers and remote team members, sometimes spanning different time zones. Since water cooler moments aren’t an option when you’re alone at a home office, it’s important to schedule remote coffee breaks, for example, where you can virtually socialize with your peers.

Virtual meetings are also an opportunity for small talk. Just because your peer works remotely, don’t assume your interactions need to be strictly business all the time. Treat virtual meetings as an extension of your physical workspace and allow time for informal, relationship-building moments of informality. It’s essential that you clearly show, whether down the hall or halfway around the world, that you value all your peers equally.

This could mean, for example, periodically adjusting your schedule as needed to accommodate peers working in different time zones. Think about who and where they are, and you’ll likely find ways to be more inclusive of remote peers. The point is that they are just as significant as your local peers.

It’s important to make sure they’re included and feel valued. Even social media can be of use in keeping in touch, nurturing and enhancing relationships with peers near and far. Use it to build and support professional connections, seek out information that helps to solve work problems, build or strengthen personal relationships with coworkers, or simply learn a little more about someone you work with.

Social media contact can also provide short, if occasional, mental breaks from work. It’s important though, not to rely on it. These little breaks and check-ins can’t replace actual, personal interaction.

Building better strategic relationships is not without its challenges, but the benefits make the effort worthwhile. Consider how supporting a stressed colleague can gain you a future ally, or how collaborating with a mentor can ultimately further your career prospects. Even helping a remote peer test for a new messaging system can solidify a friendship. The key is to be proactive, forge valuable links with your peers, and then work to keep those healthy strategic relationships going forward.
