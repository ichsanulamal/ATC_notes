During this video, you will discover how to identify best practices for planning a successful process improvement.
Objectives
identify best practices for planning a successful process improvement
A business process is a set of activities that transforms a specific set of inputs into a desired output. It may transform materials or components into a finished product. Or it might transform certain documents or requests into an order, an approval, a report, or a specific service for a costumer. Viewing business operations in terms of a series of individual interlocking processes, can make it easier to determine how your organization can perform the activities it engages in faster and better. In turn, making process improvements can boost efficiency, quality, customer satisfaction, and profit while reducing waste, cutting costs, and eliminating errors. Different methodologies for process improvement like Six Sigma and Lean have been developed, along with a wide range of tools and techniques. Approaches differ, but all effective process improvement initiatives have one thing in common. They begin with proper planning. Three best practices can help you plan a process improvement initiative so it has the best chance of success. First, use clear criteria to determine which process to prioritize. An improvement effort must be focused to succeed. Don't try to address too many processes at the same time. Rather, prioritize improvements that will yield the greatest benefit for the lowest cost and effort. Depending on your organization's needs, some examples of criteria to consider when prioritizing process for improvement might include the impact of the process on the organization or department, its staff and customers, the cost of the improvement. Or conversely, the cost to the business of not improving it, the ease or feasibility of making changes, the number of customer complaints the process is generating and so on. A process selection matrix is a useful tool for selecting which process to focus on first. To create this type of matrix, list the processes you're considering. Read each one, giving it a score for each of the selection criteria you've identified. Total the scores and then rank each process from highest to lowest, prioritizing the processes with the highest overall score. The second best practice is to create a problem statement. Albert Einstein once noted that the formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution. Once it's absolutely clear what you want to accomplish, the rest is just about figuring out how to get there. A problem statement should be short, highly specific, and motivating to the stakeholders of the process. Consider this statement, the company's inventory levels are too high, resulting in unnecessary expenditure. This problem statement is too vague. A better example would be storing excess inventory is costing the company $180,000 a year in excess carrying costs, product waste, and obsolescence. The solution suggests itself, reducing inventory to a targeted less costly level within a reasonable amount of time. A third best practice is to create a project charter. This is a document that defines a project and includes its goals, scope, key stakeholders, and details of its risks and assumptions. The goals for any process improvement project should be specific, quantifiable, achievable, and timely. The project scope specifies what the initiative will and won't cover. The main stakeholders might be sponsors, the project team, customers, and even suppliers. The charter should include all foreseeable risks, and any steps to mitigate them. As the saying goes, failing to plan is planning to fail. Diligent planning of business process improvements is vital.

3. Video: Getting Buy-in for Process Improvement (bs_aop48_a01_enus_03)

For any process improvement to take hold, it's essential to take steps to secure stakeholder buy-in from the start. In this video, you will learn how to get buy-in for process improvement initiatives. You will also discover guidelines for planning communications based on a RACI analysis of stakeholders.
Objectives
identify ways to secure and maintain buy-in for a process improvement initiative
The leading causes of failed process improvement initiatives are resistance from those who need to make the changes, and disinterest from management. For any process improvement to take hold, it's essential to take steps to secure stakeholder buy-in from the start. You can take certain steps to do this, first, involve stakeholders from the outset. Invite them to participate in brainstorming sessions to identify issues, their possible causes and effects, and to get their ideas for improvements. Those who are most familiar with an existing process, who actually do the work, or are directly affected by its outputs, have knowledge and insights that shouldn't be overlooked. Stakeholders are much more likely to support an initiative if they feel like they've helped create it, and their concerns have been acknowledged. Second, plan communications based on a RACI analysis of stakeholders. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed. RACI analysis lets you categorize stakeholders into four groups to make it easier to plan tailored communications. Stakeholders may be responsible for implementing the change, or accountable for the change, like process owners and project sponsors. They may need to be consulted about the change, like customers or suppliers, or only informed about the change. Using the matrix, decide which type of communication is needed for each stakeholder. To get buy-in, you need to communicate the right things at the right times to the different types of stakeholders. Third, schedule weekly meetings with those guiding the process improvement initiative, to keep a steady focus on the project. Early on, project sponsors and those involved in steering the project can use the meetings to contribute to and approve plans, including the project charter. Once the initiative has launched, schedule project reviews for the first month at least weekly, and then bi-weekly after that. Fourth, regularly remind stakeholders how the changes could benefit them. Different stakeholders have different wants and needs. For example, a company executive will likely be interested in the return on investment from a process change. A staff member responsible for a processing task is more likely to be interested in saving time, effort, and frustration. A customer's priorities might be efficient delivery and service quality. Focus on what's in it for each of them. Plan communications to keep different categories of stakeholders motivated. Focusing especially on those you've identified as responsible or accountable using the RACI method. This leads directly to a fifth way to get buy-in. Keep stakeholders updated on progress, don't let interest wane. Keep a focus on the initiative by regularly updating stakeholders on what has been achieved, and what still needs to be done. A sixth and final guideline is to mark and celebrate milestones. Celebrating interim achievements can help keep stakeholders motivated and invested. Getting and keeping the right people's support is essential for the success of a process improvement initiative.

4. Video: Analyzing and Redesigning a Process (bs_aop48_a01_enus_04)

Successful process improvement involves taking a systematic informed approach to analyzing and redesigning a business process. Following a sequence of steps can help you do this. In this video, you will learn how to use process mapping to enable process analysis. You will also discover the key steps for improving a process.
Objectives
identify an effective sequence of activities for analyzing and redesigning a business process
Successful process improvement involves taking a systematic informed approach to analyzing and redesigning a business process. Following a sequence of steps can help you do this. First, use process mapping to enable process analysis. Before you can improve a process, you have to understand what it involves. Process mapping is a way of doing this. A process map is a visual representation of the sequence of all the steps in a process. It typically uses labeled shapes and symbols to include information about the steps, their time sequence, relationships, and other relevant information. For example, it may identify decision points, the time and resources that activities consume, and feedback loops. Arrows typically indicate the direction of the process workflow. A swimlane is a particular type of process map that can help focus on who's responsible for each activity in a process. It's useful when multiple groups or departments are involved in the process. For example, it makes it easy to isolate points where hand-overs happen. Often, it's at these points that delays or other inefficiencies occur. Once you've mapped a process, you can use the map to identify any problem areas. Asking questions helps. For example, at which points are there delays? Are there any unnecessary feedback loops? What are the frustration points? And where in the process are quality issues being introduced? A second key step is to get stakeholder data about potential issues, their frequency and impact. Where possible involve stakeholders in brainstorming. Useful stakeholder data may also be available in a company's internal systems, like records of customer complaints or times it takes to complete process steps. Based on the data you gather, rate the potential issues based on their frequency and impact to determine which are the most significant to address. Using a matrix can help you do this. Record each issue and assign it's scores for criteria like frequency, number of incidents per month, number of customer complaints generated per quarter or financial impact. You can then total the scores and use them to rank the issues. The third step is to then prioritize the issues to address. For example, you might use Pareto analysis, sometimes known as the 80-20 rule, which says that about 80% of a problem is solved by focusing on 20% of the issues. Having already rated issues based on frequency and impact. The company can now add up the scores for the top few until they total around 80% of the total score for all the issues. This is a simple way to identify which issues deserve initial focus. Fourth, brainstorm improvement ideas. Aim to involve a diverse team of people in generating, refining, and selecting ideas for addressing the process issues. Finally, test the improvement ideas. Weigh the implications. And redesign the affected process accordingly. Consider the implications of each improvement idea for all stakeholders. Test ideas, for example, through role-play, practice runs, or computer simulations. Then, proceed with redesigning the process to minimize, or eliminate, significant issues. Following this set of steps in a systematic fashion helps ensure that the process improvement initiative will yield the best possible results.

5. Video: Implementing Process Improvement (bs_aop48_a01_enus_05)

The greatest improvement idea in history, whatever it might be, is only words on paper until it's put into action. After planning, analysis, and redesign, the next step is implementing the desired process improvement. In this video, you will learn about the key steps for implementing process improvements.
Objectives
recognize steps for implementing a successful process improvement
The greatest improvement idea in history, whatever it might be, is only words on paper until it's put into action. After planning, analysis, and redesign, the next step is implementing the desired process improvement, putting it into action. This involves four-key steps. First, assemble a team and other required resources. It's ideal if the team driving the change includes people directly responsible for overseeing the affected process. Other needed resources will depend on the nature of the initiative. For instance, it might be necessary to acquire or adapt equipment, or to reorganize the physical layout of a work area. Improving a process could involve changing existing job roles, recruiting additional staff members, or hiring contractors, or consultants. Changes might require specialized training for existing personnel. You might need to involve HR, administrative, legal, and other personnel from different departments. Many improvements need at least temporary support for more technical resources in the IT function or the acquisition of new technology. You'll need to secure the required financial resources for these additional investments. Second, determine detailed tasks, and assign responsibilities and due dates. Effective project management is essential for success. This includes breaking down the work that's required into clear, discrete tasks. In project management terms, creating a work breakdown structure. It also involves assigning responsibility and deadlines for tasks. Keeping track of what's happening for all aspects of the project and managing resources. Third, track progress and adjust as necessary. Establish clear matrix for measuring progress and return on investment, and use these to track and report progress. Periodically review the project plan, and update, and adjust it as necessary to keep the initiative on track. Communicate progress regularly to key stakeholders. Finally, putting process improvements into action may mean finding ways to overcome obstacles and resistance. This isn't something you can take care of just in the early phases of a process improvement initiative. Instead, it has to be an ongoing effort. Throughout the implementation process, communicate regularly with stakeholders, and keep them motivated and invested. Best practices to accomplish this include involving affected employees in planning and decision-making. Acknowledging their concerns, and making the personal benefits of changes clear. Also, address fears regarding any changes in workload, responsibilities or compensation. Implementing some process improvements can be as simple as say, switching vendors or shipping agents. Others may require complex intricate changes to staff, facilities, and systems. In either extreme or anywhere in between, the key implementation steps remain the same. Simple or complex, there are no shortcuts.

6. Video: Sustaining Continual Process Improvement (bs_aop48_a01_enus_06)

The real challenge isn't in making one-off changes to a business process. It's in continually improving the process and sustaining those changes over the long term. In this video, you will learn strategies for sustaining continuous improvement.
Objectives
identify strategies for sustaining continual improvements to business processes
The real challenge isn't in making one-off changes to a business process. It's in continually improving the process and sustaining those changes over the long term. The continuous improvement process is an ongoing effort to improve processes beyond the initial initiative, seeking further improvement over time. There are certain strategies that can help this along. The first is to periodically review the process performance using established metrics and taking any needed actions to maintain improvements. Use appropriate metrics agreed upon by directly involved stakeholders to make sure the improvement measures initially implemented are moving in the right direction and that the changes are sustained. In some cases, software can simplify performance monitoring. For many improvements, a simplified dashboard might make it easy to track multiple metrics using real time data available at a glance. Make it standard practice to conduct a review of the process at least once every six months. Based on your findings, take any needed action to bring the performance of the process back in line. Or to start another improvement initiative. Second, entrench the changes through codified standard operating procedures, work instructions, and training. This is how you institutionalize process improvements, how you can make them stick. For example, make sure training for new hires is updated to incorporate the new ways of working. It might also be relevant to create or update checklists for existing employees to follow. Updates to employees' job descriptions may also be appropriate, where those roles have been affected. Related to job descriptions and performance is a third strategy, taking the time to acknowledge and celebrate successes. Celebration and recognition help keep stakeholders motivated by communicating and rewarding positive results. This shows that the organization values improvement efforts, and encourages a sense of ownership, contributing to sustained change. But it further helps employees, especially those whose work is directly affected by the process changes, see that their efforts are paying off. And that their work matters and has a positive effect on the company's success. Finally, periodically revise metrics and targets. This is to account for changing circumstances. As time passes, new circumstances arise, new technologies are released, new competitors enter the market. New markets emerge. A wide range of internal or external factors may change over the course of time. They may change a company's business strategies or a process, yet again. This also drives further improvement. For modern businesses, continuously looking for and implementing ways to generate greater efficiencies, increase productivity, and cut cost, is key to staying competitive. Sustaining positive changes and continuing to build on them is a team effort. It takes planning and ongoing adjustment, but it also equips an organization to grow and thrive in a rapidly changing, competitive business environment.

Feedback:
Option 1:
This option is correct. You don't want interest to wane. Keep a focus on the initiative by regularly updating stakeholders on what's been achieved and what still needs to be done.
Option 2:
This option is correct. Different stakeholders have different needs and interests. It's important to recognize these and target communications accordingly. Stakeholders will more readily support an initiative if they're clear on how it could benefit them.
Option 3:
This option is correct. Celebrating interim achievements can help keep stakeholders motivated and invested.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. To secure stakeholder buy-in, you need to get stakeholder input as soon as it's decided that process improvement is going to take place – in other words, from the planning phase on – rather than waiting until the initiative has commenced.
Option 5:
This option is incorrect. Communications should be tailored based on stakeholders' interests and levels of involvement. Also, communication should occur much more regularly than just once a quarter.
Option 6:
This option is correct. Stakeholders are more likely to support an initiative if they've helped shape it and feel their concerns have been addressed.
Option 7:
This option is correct. It's best to tailor communications to different groups of stakeholders based on their levels of involvement and interest in the initiative. One tool that can help with this is RACI analysis, which involves categorizing stakeholders based on whether they're responsible for the initiative, accountable, need to be consulted, or need only to be informed about progress.
Option 8:
Organize regular weekly meetings with those steering the initiative.
Question 3: Ranking

D.
Generate improvement ideas
E.
Assess, test, and implement improvements
Answer
1.
Create a visual map showing the sequence of all steps in the existing process
The first step is process mapping, which involves representing all the steps in the existing process and recording relevant information about them, including their sequence and relationships and the time and resources they use. This makes it possible to analyze the process.
2.
Collect stakeholder information about issues and their frequency and impact
The second step is to get stakeholder data about process issues, including their frequency and impact. Additional data may be obtained from a company's internal systems – for example, from customer complaint records. The issues can then be prioritized.
3.
Perform a Pareto analysis to identify issues to focus on
The third step is to prioritize the issues to address. One technique for doing this is Pareto analysis, which involves scoring each issue and then identifying those few that account for the greatest percentage of the problems.
4.
Generate improvement ideas
The fourth step is to brainstorm improvement ideas for addressing high-priority issues. It's usually beneficial to involve a diverse group of stakeholders in this process.
5.
Assess, test, and implement improvements
The fifth step is to assess, select, and test improvement ideas – for example, by conducting trial runs. Then the best ideas can be implemented to redesign the process.

Option 2:
This option is correct. It's important to communicate with stakeholders throughout the implementation process, to keep them updated and overcome any resistance to the changes. The success of a process improvement depends on successful change management too.
Option 3:
This option is incorrect. It's important to control the scope of the initiative so it has the desired outcome and doesn't cost more in time and resources than agreed upon.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. It's important to keep communicating with stakeholders, addressing any fears or resistance to the changes and reminding them how the process improvement could benefit them.
Option 5:
This option is correct. To get the required work done and keep the initiative on track, it's necessary to break the work down into tasks, assign responsibility for each task, and then set clear task deadlines.
Option 6:
This option is correct. Making sure the right resources are available is key to the success of any project. Examples of resources include funds, equipment, and personnel. Ideally, the team should include people directly responsible for overseeing the process to be improved.
Question 5: Multiple Choice

Option 2:
This option is correct. Periodically revise metrics and targets to account for changing circumstances and to drive further improvements to the process.
Option 3:
This option is incorrect. It's vital to manage any resistance to change, to prevent improvements achieved so far from being derailed.
Option 4:
This option is incorrect. Sustaining continuous improvement depends on staying open to the potential for further change and creating a culture where everyone contributes to improvement ideas.
Option 5:
This option is correct. To sustain improvements, you should check the performance of the process at least once every six months and, based on your findings, take corrective action as needed. The metrics used for monitoring should be agreed upon by directly involved stakeholders.
Option 6:
This option is correct. Standard operating procedures, work instructions, and training should all be updated to incorporate the changes made during the improvement effort. This helps ensure nobody reverts to old ways of working.
