# Using Lean to Improve Flow and Pull

Here's the content reformatted for clearer learning:

### Visual Cues in Communication

- **Importance of Visual Cues**: The brain processes visual information quickly. Visual cues (e.g., road signs, charts) enhance communication effectiveness.
- **Benefits**:
  - Convey information rapidly.
  - Reduce repeated verbal communication and documentation.
  - Example: A pie chart is quicker to understand than a lengthy description.

### Visual Workplace

- **Definition**: A visual workplace utilizes visual cues to convey information effectively.
- **Examples**:
  - **Signs**: Electrical hazard warnings.
  - **Color-Coded Systems**: Helps with quick identification (e.g., filing systems).
  - **Maps**: Assist navigation in environments like hospitals.

- **Waste Reduction**: A visual workplace minimizes time wasted searching for resources and clarifies roles and responsibilities, reducing accidents and errors.

### Visual Office vs. Visual Factory

- **Visual Office**: Displays roles, organization, and goals for employees.
- **Visual Factory**: Managers and employees can see current process statuses and correct procedures.

### Goals of a Visual Workplace

1. Complete work properly, safely, and on schedule.
2. Standardize procedures and maintain order.
3. Reduce employee stress and improve morale.

### Visual Workplace Tools

- **Types of Tools**:
  1. **Work Instructions**: Simple guides placed near tasks.
  2. **Process Flow Diagrams**: Standardize workflow to reduce errors.
  3. **Labels**: Identify equipment and materials, reducing search time.
  4. **Andons**: Color-coded lights to convey status (e.g., traffic lights).
  5. **Status Boards**: Update performance metrics and project status.

### Just-in-Time System

- **Definition**: A supply management approach that aligns inventory with customer demand.
- **Key Components**:
  1. **Good Communication**: Understand customer needs and train employees.
  2. **Pull System**: Production based on actual demand, not forecasts.
  
- **Benefits**: Reduces excess inventory and storage costs.

### Kanban System Implementation

- **Definition**: A signaling system that indicates when supplies are needed.
- **Key Rules**:
  1. Withdraw items only in specified amounts.
  2. Send only correct amounts downstream.
  3. Defective items must not be sent.
  4. A Kanban card must accompany items at all times.

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Conduct a survey of needed supplies.
  2. Establish minimum and maximum supply levels.
  3. Create a standardized supply order form.
  4. Implement a color-coded Kanban system.
  5. Standardize work processes for consistent use.

### Line Balancing Goals

- **Definition**: Ensuring even work distribution to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Goals**:
  1. **Even Work Distribution**: Prevents worker overburdening and delays.
  2. **Optimal Worker Numbers**: Match worker count to production needs.

- **Rebalancing**: Adjust for peak demand periods to maintain efficiency.

### Calculating Takt Time

- **Definition**: The work rate needed to meet customer demand.
- **Calculation Steps**:
  1. Determine available work time (subtract breaks).
  2. Divide available work time by customer demand.

- **Example**: 
  - Available work time: 420 minutes.
  - Customer demand: 240 queries/day.
  - Takt time = 420 minutes / 240 queries = 1.75 minutes/query.

- **Importance**: Aligns production/service time with customer demand to prevent backlog or surplus.
