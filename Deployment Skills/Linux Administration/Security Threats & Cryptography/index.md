# Security Threats & Cryptography

## 1. Common Linux Security Threats

Linux technicians should be aware of common Linux threats to effectively prepare defenses. Key threats include:

**Social Engineering**: This involves manipulating individuals into disclosing sensitive information or granting access to secure resources. Techniques include:

- **Impersonation**: Attackers may pose as authority figures (e.g., government officials, law enforcement) to gain compliance.
- **Phishing**: Messages that appear legitimate may trick users into clicking links or downloading attachments, leading to malware installation.
- **Extortion**: Victims may receive threats, such as claims that compromising webcam footage will be released unless a ransom is paid.

Physical access to systems increases vulnerability. Attackers can impersonate technicians to gain unauthorized access to secure areas.

**Phishing Example**: A user might receive an email that appears official, prompting them to click a link or download a file. This action could install malware or direct them to a fraudulent site to harvest credentials.

**Ransomware**: Victims receive emails with malicious attachments or links. Once executed, the ransomware encrypts files and demands ransom for decryption.

**Common Malware Infection Process**:
1. Reconnaissance to identify targets.
2. Phishing to trick users into taking action.
3. Malware infection initiated by user actions.
4. Consequences include blackmail, data exfiltration, data encryption, or launching attacks.

**Linux-Specific Threats**:
- **Default Settings**: Using default usernames and passwords is risky, especially in cloud environments.
- **Exposure to the Internet**: Directly exposing Linux hosts increases visibility to attackers. Utilize a jump box for secure internal connections.
- **Encryption**: Lack of encryption at network and storage levels poses risks.
- **Weak Passwords**: Short passwords and improper permissions can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Updates**: Failing to apply updates can leave systems susceptible to attacks.

Awareness of these threats and implementing security measures can significantly reduce risk.

## 2. The CIA Security Triad

The CIA security triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—applies to Linux in several critical ways:

**Confidentiality**: Ensures sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users, in line with contractual or regulatory requirements.

- **Encryption**: Implement encryption for data at rest (e.g., disk encryption for Linux hosts) and data in transit (e.g., using SSH instead of Telnet, and HTTPS instead of HTTP).
- **Access Control**: Use the principle of least privilege by granting only necessary permissions to user accounts, such as those for web server daemons (e.g., Apache).
- **Claims-Based Access**: Implement claims that detail user attributes (e.g., employment status) to control access based on authentication.
- **Web Security**: Use PKI certificates for HTTPS, disable HTTP access, and ensure web servers are regularly patched and updated.

**Integrity**: Assures the trustworthiness of data and protects against unauthorized modifications.

- **File System Integrity**: Utilize hashing algorithms to create unique hashes for files or databases. A matching hash indicates no changes, while a different hash suggests tampering.
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensure network integrity through digital signatures, which are created using a sender’s private key and verified with the corresponding public key.
- **Auditing**: Implement targeted auditing of system and data access logs to monitor for unauthorized activity without overwhelming data management.

**Availability**: Guarantees that IT services and data are consistently accessible.

- **Recovery Objectives**: Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for maximum tolerable downtime and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for acceptable data loss, guiding backup frequency.
- **Data Replication**: Replicate data to alternate locations to ensure availability during disruptions.
- **Load Balancing**: Utilize load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple backend servers, enhancing application availability. Implement autoscaling to accommodate increased demand dynamically.

Understanding and implementing these principles within the context of Linux helps maintain a robust security posture aligned with the CIA triad.

## 3. Cryptography

Cryptography plays a vital role in the confidentiality aspect of the CIA security triad, ensuring data security through confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

**Confidentiality**:
- **Encryption**: Used to secure network communication (e.g., VPNs, IPsec, SSH, HTTPS) and for file system encryption (e.g., full disk encryption or software solutions integrated with Trusted Platform Modules).
- **Key Management**: 
  - **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Involves asymmetric encryption, where a public key encrypts data and a private key decrypts it. The public key can be shared openly, enhancing security.
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption. This poses challenges in large environments, such as secure key distribution.
  
The encryption process takes plaintext (e.g., "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") and transforms it into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key. Decryption reverses this process. Protecting encryption keys is crucial; if they are compromised, the security of the data is at risk.

**Integrity**:
- Ensures data authenticity and detects unauthorized modifications using techniques like hashing. Hashing generates a unique fixed-length output from data, and any change will result in a different hash value.
- Integrity is important in legal contexts for evidence verification (e.g., generating a hash of a disk image to track changes).
- **Digital Signatures**: Used to verify authenticity and integrity of messages, such as in encrypted emails.

**Cryptographic Algorithms**:
- Common encryption algorithms include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
- Hashing algorithms include the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).

Understanding these concepts helps ensure robust data protection through effective cryptographic practices.

## 4. Managing Linux File System Encryption

In this demo, we explored file system encryption on a Linux host, focusing on both individual file encryption and entire disk partition encryption.

**Individual File Encryption**:
1. **Install GPG**: Start by installing the `gnupg2` package using `sudo apt install gnupg2`.
2. **Encrypt a File**: Use `gpg --symmetric Project_A.txt` to encrypt the file. You'll be prompted for a passphrase.
3. **Check Output**: This creates a new file, `Project_A.txt.gpg`, while retaining the original. Remove the original for security.
4. **Decrypt the File**: To decrypt, run `gpg --output Project_A.txt --decrypt Project_A.txt.gpg`. Enter the passphrase to restore the original file.

**Disk Partition Encryption**:
1. **Create a Partition**: Use `sudo fdisk /dev/sde` to create a new primary partition.
2. **Install Cryptsetup**: Install the `cryptsetup` tool via `sudo apt install cryptsetup`.
3. **Format the Partition**: Run `sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sde` to encrypt the partition, providing a passphrase.
4. **Unlock the Partition**: Use `sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sde cryptpart` to unlock it for use.
5. **Create a Filesystem**: Format it with `sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/cryptpart`.
6. **Mount the Partition**: Create a directory (`/vault`) and mount the encrypted partition with `sudo mount /dev/mapper/cryptpart /vault`.

This ensures that data remains secure, both at rest and during access, with files created in the mounted partition being automatically encrypted.

## 5. Integrity

Integrity and authentication are crucial for ensuring trust in data, whether it’s being transmitted over a network or stored on a file system. Here’s a breakdown of how these concepts can be implemented, especially through file hashing and digital signatures.

### File Hashing
1. **Purpose**: File hashing provides a way to verify the integrity of data. By generating a unique hash value (or message digest) for a file, you can detect if that file has been tampered with.
   
2. **One-Way Function**: Hashing algorithms act like a lobster trap—easy to enter (process the data), but nearly impossible to reverse (retrieve the original data from the hash). This means there's no key involved, unlike encryption.

3. **Detection**: If you hash a file today and compare it to a hash generated a week ago, any change in the file will yield a different hash value. This discrepancy indicates a modification, which may need further investigation to determine if it was authorized.

4. **Legal Context**: In digital forensics, generating a hash of seized storage media ensures the integrity of evidence. Hashes can prove that original data remains untampered with, which is crucial for legal admissibility.

5. **Common Algorithms**: Examples of hashing algorithms include:
   - **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**: For example, SHA-256 generates a 256-bit hash.
   - **MD5 (Message Digest 5)**: An older and now deprecated option due to vulnerabilities.

### Digital Signatures
1. **Email Signing**: When sending an email, you can use your private key to sign the message. The recipient uses your public key to verify your signature, ensuring the message's authenticity and integrity.

2. **PowerShell Scripts**: PowerShell scripts can be digitally signed to ensure that only trusted scripts are executed on machines. This provides an extra layer of security in environments where scripts can alter system behavior.

### Implementation in Linux
1. **Hashing a File**: Using the `sha256sum` command on a Linux system, you can generate a hash for a file. If you modify the file (e.g., by appending text), re-running the `sha256sum` command will yield a different hash value, indicating a change.

   Example commands:
   ```bash
   sha256sum hello.sh > hash.txt  # Save hash to a file
   echo "new data" >> hello.sh      # Modify the file
   sha256sum hello.sh                # Check the new hash
   ```

2. **Storing Hashes**: You can save the hash values to a file using output redirection. This is useful for tracking changes over time, especially for website files.

### VPNs and Cryptocurrencies
- **VPNs**: Corporate VPNs ensure secure and authenticated connections between branch offices or remote workers, protecting data in transit.
- **Cryptocurrency**: Blockchain technology uses hashing to validate transactions, ensuring that the data has not been altered.

### Conclusion
Overall, file hashing and digital signatures are essential tools for maintaining data integrity and authenticity. They allow organizations to trust that their data has not been tampered with, whether it’s for operational security, legal compliance, or personal assurance.

## 6. Generating File System Hashes Using Linux

Detecting changes to files is essential for ensuring data integrity, whether you're checking for corruption after a transfer or monitoring for unauthorized modifications. Let’s break down the steps to generate file system hashes in a Linux environment and discuss how this can be useful.

### 1. **Generating File Hashes**
To start, you can use various hashing algorithms available on Linux. Here’s how you can generate hashes for a file:

#### Checking Current File Hash
```bash
ls  # Lists files in the current directory
cat Project_A.txt  # Displays the content of Project_A.txt
```

#### Using Hashing Commands
- **MD5 Hash**:
  ```bash
  sudo md5sum Project_A.txt
  ```
  This returns a unique hash value, but MD5 is not recommended for security purposes due to vulnerabilities.

- **SHA-256 Hash**:
  ```bash
  sudo sha256sum Project_A.txt
  ```
  This will produce a more secure hash. You can try SHA-512 for an even longer hash:
  ```bash
  sudo sha512sum Project_A.txt
  ```

### 2. **Detecting Changes**
To demonstrate how changes affect the hash, you can modify the file:

#### Editing the File
```bash
sudo nano Project_A.txt  # Opens the file in the nano editor
```
Add some text, save the file, and then run the `sha256sum` command again to see the new hash value.

### 3. **User Password Hashes**
On Linux systems, user passwords are hashed for security. You can view these hashes in the `/etc/shadow` file:

```bash
sudo tail /etc/shadow  # Displays the last lines of the shadow file
```
The second field contains the hashed password for the user, showcasing how hashing secures sensitive data.

### 4. **Rainbow Tables and Salting**
Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it’s designed not to be reversed. However, attackers can use **rainbow tables**—precomputed tables of hash values for common passwords. To mitigate this risk, modern systems often use **salting**, which adds random data to the password before hashing, making it much harder to crack.

### 5. **Automating Hash Checks with a Script**
To continuously monitor file changes, you can create a simple shell script that hashes a file and logs the output:

#### Example Script (`hashscript.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables for date
day=$(date +%d)
month=$(date +%m)
year=$(date +%Y)

# Hashing the file and appending to log
sha512sum file1.txt >> file_hash_history.txt
echo "Hash value for file1.txt on $day-$month-$year" >> file_hash_history.txt
echo "" >> file_hash_history.txt  # Adds a new line for spacing
```

#### Running the Script
Make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x hashscript.sh
./hashscript.sh
```

Check the `file_hash_history.txt` to see the logged hash values along with timestamps.

### 6. **Scheduling with Cron**
You can automate this script to run at regular intervals using `cron`. For example, to run it daily:
```bash
crontab -e  # Edit the crontab file
```
Add a line like:
```
0 0 * * * /path/to/hashscript.sh
```
This schedules the script to run daily at midnight.

### Conclusion
Using hashing in a Linux environment is an effective way to monitor file integrity and detect unauthorized changes. By generating hashes, automating the logging process, and employing good security practices like salting, you can maintain a secure and trustworthy system.

## 7. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a critical framework for managing digital certificates and encryption keys, establishing a chain of trust for secure communications. Let’s break down the essential components of PKI and how it operates.

### 1. **Chain of Trust**
At the heart of PKI is the concept of the **chain of trust**. When a device trusts a Certificate Authority (CA) at the top of the hierarchy, it inherently trusts any subordinate certificates issued by that CA. This chain ensures that certificates can be validated without requiring direct trust in every single one.

### 2. **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**
CAs are pivotal in PKI, issuing digital certificates that validate the identity of entities. There are two main types of CAs:

- **Public Trusted CAs**: Widely recognized and trusted by operating systems and browsers. Certificates issued by these CAs enable secure connections, such as HTTPS, without additional configuration.
  
- **Private/Internal CAs**: Organizations can create their own CAs for internal use. While they offer greater control over certificate management, devices must have the CA's root certificate installed to trust certificates issued by it. This often involves deploying the CA’s public key across the organization’s devices using tools like Ansible or Puppet.

### 3. **Using Private CAs**
When utilizing a private CA, any web server that uses a certificate from this CA will generate warning messages for users, as the CA isn’t recognized by default. To avoid this, the CA's root certificate must be installed on client devices.

### 4. **Creating a PKI**
You can establish a PKI on various platforms, including:

- **Microsoft Windows Server**: Setting up a private CA involves selecting appropriate role services.
  
- **Cloud Platforms (e.g., AWS)**: You can create a CA in the cloud, starting with a root CA, and then potentially adding subordinate CAs to distribute the certificate issuance.

### 5. **PKI Hierarchy**
Visualizing the PKI structure:
- **Root CA**: The topmost authority, responsible for issuing certificates to subordinate CAs.
- **Subordinate CAs**: They can issue their own certificates, adding layers to the PKI. The root CA is often kept offline for security, minimizing exposure in case of compromise.

### 6. **Certificate Templates**
Templates serve as blueprints for creating certificates, specifying parameters such as:
- **Encryption and Signing Algorithms**: Defining how data will be secured.
- **Usage Constraints**: Indicating the specific purpose of the certificate, such as email encryption or digital signatures.

### 7. **Certificate Components**
PKI certificates include critical information such as:
- **Subject Name**: The entity's identifier, like a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or email address.
- **Issuing CA Name**: Who issued the certificate.
- **Digital Signature**: Ensures the certificate's integrity.
- **Validity Dates**: Certificates have expiration dates, similar to passports.

### 8. **Public and Private Keys**
A PKI certificate includes a **public key**, but the **private key** is stored securely elsewhere. This separation is crucial for maintaining security:
- **Public Key**: Used to encrypt data or verify signatures.
- **Private Key**: Kept secure, used for decrypting data or creating digital signatures.

### Conclusion
PKI is foundational for secure communications in modern computing. By establishing a trusted hierarchy through CAs and leveraging digital certificates, organizations can protect sensitive data and verify identities effectively. Understanding PKI’s structure and operations is essential for managing security in both internal and external communications.

## 8. The PKI Certificate Lifecycle

The PKI certificate lifecycle is essential for managing the validity and security of digital certificates. Let’s break down the lifecycle stages and key concepts involved:

### 1. **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**
The lifecycle begins with the **CSR**, which is a request to a Certificate Authority (CA) to issue a certificate. Key steps include:
- **Key Pair Generation**: Create a unique public and private key pair.
- **Request Submission**: Submit the CSR to the CA, including details like:
  - Common Name (e.g., FQDN or email address)
  - Organization Name
  - Country
  - Contact Information

### 2. **Issuance**
After receiving the CSR, the CA performs due diligence to validate the request. This may include checking the legitimacy of the organization or individual requesting the certificate. Once verified, the CA issues the certificate, which can then be installed on devices or applications for various uses (e.g., secure web traffic, email encryption).

### 3. **Use**
Once issued, the certificate can be used for:
- **Encryption**: Protecting data in transit.
- **Authentication**: Verifying identities in secure connections.
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensuring the integrity of messages or documents.

Certificates can exist in different forms, such as:
- **File-based**: Stored on a device.
- **Smartcards**: Embedded for secure authentication.

### 4. **Revocation**
Certificates may need to be revoked before their expiration due to reasons such as:
- **Loss or Theft**: If a device or credentials are compromised.
- **Change of Ownership**: If the organization changes names or ownership.

Revocation is managed through:
- **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**: A list of revoked certificates that services can download to check against.
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**: A real-time query method that checks the status of individual certificates, offering a more efficient alternative to CRLs.

### 5. **Renewal/Expiry**
Certificates have a limited lifespan and must be renewed before they expire. This process involves:
- Creating a new CSR.
- Submitting it to the CA for a new certificate.

If not renewed, the certificate becomes invalid, similar to an expired driver’s license, requiring a new issuance process.

### **Certificate Types and Considerations**
- **Wildcard Certificates**: These can secure multiple subdomains, simplifying management.
- **Extended Validation (EV) Certificates**: Require thorough vetting of the requesting organization, often used for e-commerce.
- **Code Signing Certificates**: Used by developers to ensure software integrity and authenticity, particularly in app stores.

### **Chain of Trust**
The PKI hierarchy relies on a **chain of trust**:
- Trusted Root CAs form the foundation.
- Subordinate CAs issue certificates based on their trustworthiness.
  
If you set up a private CA, you must import its root certificate into devices to establish trust, as they won’t trust it by default.

### **Managing Revocation and Status**
- **CRL**: Regularly updated and can be downloaded by devices to stay current with revoked certificates.
- **OCSP**: Provides on-demand verification, reducing the need to manage large lists of revoked certificates.

### **Conclusion**
Understanding the PKI certificate lifecycle is crucial for maintaining secure communications. Each stage, from CSR creation to renewal and revocation, plays a vital role in ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of digital certificates in various applications. By effectively managing this lifecycle, organizations can protect their digital identities and secure communications effectively.

     mkdir ~/csr
     cd ~/csr
     ```
   - Generate an RSA key pair:
     ```
     openssl genrsa -out ubuntu1server.key 2048
     ```
   - Create a CSR using the generated key:
     ```
     openssl req -new -key ubuntu1server.key -out ubuntu1server.req
     ```
   - Input the required information for the CSR:
     - Country Name (e.g., CA)
     - State or Province Name (e.g., Ontario)
     - Locality Name (e.g., Toronto)
     - Organization Name (e.g., Quick24x7)
     - Common Name (e.g., www.quick24x7.com)
     - Email Address (e.g., cblackwell@quick24x7.com)
  
7. **Files Generated**:

    - Note the expiration date of the certificate (e.g., valid for 825 days).

11. **Locate the Issued Certificate**:
    - Change to the directory containing issued certificates:
      ```
      cd pki/issued
      ```
    - List the files:
      ```
      ls
      ```
    - The issued certificate file (`ubuntu1server.crt`) is now available.

This process outlines how to acquire a PKI certificate from a private CA on a Linux host.

## 11. SSL and TLS

HTTP network encryption uses two main protocols: SSL (deprecated) and TLS. 

SSL, initiated by Netscape in the early 1990s, is outdated and vulnerable to numerous attacks. Thus, it should never be used; both server and client sides can disable it. Instead, TLS is recommended, with at least version 1.2, ideally 1.3. Security technicians should stay updated on these versions.

TLS operates on HTTPS servers, requiring a PKI certificate for HTTPS binding, typically on TCP port 443. Client-side checks in web browsers can indicate whether SSL or TLS is in use, though TLS is always preferred. Often, references to "SSL certificates" are inaccurate; these are actually PKI certificates. Various security protocols, including TLS and IPsec, utilize these certificates.

TLS communication involves several steps: 

1. The client contacts the server on port 443, presenting its supported ciphers.
2. The server and client agree on a cipher suite.
3. The server sends its PKI certificate, which contains the public key.
4. The client validates the certificate and generates a unique session key, encrypting it with the server's public key to send back.
5. The server decrypts the session key with its private key, securing further communication.

TLS traffic appears scrambled in packet captures, indicating effective encryption. For instance, a Wireshark capture shows TLS headers and hexadecimal data that cannot be deciphered without the key.

In Microsoft Azure, you can create a key vault to generate PKI certificates for cloud and on-premises use. Certificates can be self-signed or issued by a public CA, with configurable validity periods. These certificates enable HTTPS bindings for web applications.

When defining a web application in Azure, you can choose the underlying platform, including Linux, either as a Docker container or a standard HTTP server. The application must use a PKI certificate for HTTPS, even if you don't have direct access to the Linux host.

## 12. Enabling an HTTPS Binding

To configure HTTPS binding on an Apache 2 web server in Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. **Install Apache**:  
   Run the command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```
   Verify installation with:
   ```bash
   sudo service apache2 status
   ```

2. **Check IP Address**:  
   Use:
   ```bash
   ip a
   ```
   Note the private IP address (e.g., 10.0.0.4). Test HTTP access:
   ```bash
   curl http://10.0.0.4:82
   ```

3. **Manage Certificate**:  
   Change to the directory containing your certificate:
   ```bash
   cd easy-rsa/pki/issued/
   ```
   Check the certificate:
   ```bash
   cat ubuntu1server.crt
   ```
   Ensure the common name matches the server DNS (www.quick24x7.com).

4. **Update Hosts File**:  
   Edit the `/etc/hosts` file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hosts
   ```
   Add the line:
   ```
   10.0.0.4 www.quick24x7.com
   ```

5. **Copy Certificates**:  
   Create a directory for the certificates:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /etc/certificate
   sudo cp ubuntu1server.crt /etc/certificate/
   sudo cp ubuntu1server.key /etc/certificate/
   ```

6. **Enable SSL Module**:  
   Run:
   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod ssl
   sudo a2enmod rewrite
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

7. **Configure Apache for HTTPS**:  
   Edit the main configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
   ```
   Ensure the following is set in the `<VirtualHost *:443>` block:
   ```
   SSLEngine on
   SSLCertificateFile /etc/certificate/ubuntu1server.crt
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/certificate/ubuntu1server.key
   ```
   Test the configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo apache2ctl configtest
   ```

8. **Trust CA Certificate**:  
   Copy the CA certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /home/cblackwell/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
   ```
   Update CA certificates:
   ```bash
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

9. **Test HTTPS**:  
   Run the curl command to test HTTPS:
   ```bash
   curl https://www.quick24x7.com
   ```

This process successfully enables HTTPS binding for your Apache web server.
