Cloud and Containers for the SRE: Containers
Containers in cloud computing are a form of operating system virtualization that allows users or administrators to deploy and run applications without the need for virtual machines. Containers can be deployed and run virtually anywhere, and support Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems.

In this course, you'll explore the various types of container solutions, including Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS. You'll outline how containers enable a more efficient continuous integration and delivery system and why they're needed for SRE.

You'll also examine container storage, security, and migration. You'll list the high-availability solutions available for containers and investigate the Containers as a Service concept. Lastly, you'll recognize how the container ecosystem is revolutionizing software delivery, and identify the role of Docker and Kubernetes in container orchestration.
