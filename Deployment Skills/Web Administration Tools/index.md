   Open your web browser (e.g., Firefox) and type `localhost` in the address bar. If installed correctly, you should see the message "Welcome to Nginx!" If not, you may have another web server running, which you can remove or configure Nginx to run on a different port.

3. **Locate Default Files**  
   To find where the default files are served from, run:
   ```bash
   ls /usr/share/nginx/html
   ```
   You should see files like `50x.html` and `index.html`.

### Creating a New Directory for Your HTML Files
1. **Create a Directory**  
   Create a new directory for your HTML files:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /var/www
   ```

2. **Change Ownership**  
   To allow your user and the web server to access the directory, change the ownership:
   ```bash
   sudo adduser <your_username> www-data
   sudo chown <your_username>:www-data /var/www
   ```

3. **Create Subdirectory**  
   Navigate to `/var/www` and create a subdirectory for your project:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www
   mkdir default
   ```

   After saving your changes, restart Nginx to apply the new configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```

### Adding Your HTML File
1. **Create an Index File**  
   Navigate to the `default` directory and create an `index.html` file:
   ```bash
   cd default
   vim index.html
   ```
   Add the text "Hello, World!" to the file and save it.

2. **Test Your Setup**  
   In your web browser, go to `localhost`. You should now see "Hello, World!" displayed.

### Changing the Listening Port
1. **Modify Listening Port**  
   If you need to run Nginx on a different port (e.g., 8080), edit the configuration:
   ```nginx
   listen 8080 default_server;
   listen [::]:8080 default_server ipv6only=on;
   ```

2. **Restart Nginx Again**  
   Restart Nginx to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```

3. **Access the New Port**  
   In your web browser, type `localhost:8080` to see your "Hello, World!" message.
